(NYSE: DIS), by paying $2.6 billion for the Indian subcontinent streaming rights to the IPL cricket tournament for 2023 through 2027, with many observers insisting this was a misstep for Disney.\nThese same observers declined to fixate on the fact Disney secured the television rights to broadcast the matches in the Indian subcontinent from 2023 to 2027 for $3 billion, and most of them failed to emphasize that Disney was not aggressively focused on retaining the streaming rights.\nIn many ways, this epitomizes the problem in trying to determine how Disney competes against its rivals. The company has a history of inventing new playing fields and quickly dominating fields created by others.\nBut will the current environment demand a bold new game plan for a company that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year?\nFrom Game-Changer To Game-Usurper: Disney holds the distinction of being the only studio from Hollywood’s Golden Age that was never gobbled up by conglomerates or investors — although it did fend off an unwelcome hostile takeover bid in 1984.\nIn the years when Walt Disney was in charge, the company created new environments by bringing sounding to cartoons and then stretching the animated shorts into feature-length films. Disney established the nature documentary as a genre within non-fiction filmmaking and embraced television in the 1950s when other studios viewed the medium as a menace.\nDisney was not the first film producer to explore product merchandising, but he went forth with an audacity and success rate that was without precedent. The company’s expansion into theme parks and the travel and hospitality sector was also groundbreaking for an entertainment company.\nIn the years that followed Walt Disney’s passing in 1967, the company would never be the bold entity to create new opportunities. For example, Disney was not the first studio to explore the potential of videocassettes in the home entertainment market — 20th Century Fox began licensing their films to the Magnetic Video label in 1977, with Disney following suit later in the decade by licensing some of their titles to DiscoVision for the ill-fated LaserDisc format.\nDisney was also later than other companies in arriving on the Internet (Disney.com turned up in 1996), in the cable television market (Disney Channel went on the air in 1983), in the app world (DisneyNow debuted in 2017) and in the streaming sector (Disney+ premiered in 2019).\nWhile it quickly played catch-up to take prominence in those spaces, sometimes its tardiness came with a price: in its second-quarter 2022 earnings report, the company acknowledged that it paid more than $1 billion to “a customer to early terminate license agreements for film and television content delivered in previous years.” In translation, it meant it had to fork over a lot of money to regain properties it licensed before getting around to start Disney+.\nSee Also: 5 Strangest Disney-Related Productions You've Probably Never Seen\nStill In The Race: Disney’s prominence in the current entertainment industry has its foundation in four key acquisitions during Bob Iger’s term as chief executive: the purchases of Pixar in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 21st Century Fox in 2019. With these acquisitions, the company bulked up its portfolio with a surplus of audience-favorite material that was effectively dispatched to the company’s various platforms and sectors.\nIn 2021, Disney had four of the year’s top 10 grossing films, more than any studio, with three of the films — “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings,” “Black Widow” ..."}, {"title": "Meta Platforms' (META) Creator-Friendly Policy to Aid Engagement", "source": {"name": "Zacks Investment Research", "homepage_url": "https://www.zacks.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"}, "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1943109/meta-platforms-meta-creator-friendly-policy-to-aid-engagement", "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is continuing its creator-friendly policy by opening up new opportunities for creators to monetize their businesses across its platforms."}, {"title": "This star hedge-fund manager says some major tech names are now value plays, as he shorts one meme-stock favorite", "source": {"name": "MarketWatch", "homepage_url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/marketwatch.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/marketwatch.ico"}, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-star-hedge-fund-manager-says-some-major-tech-names-are-now-value-plays-as-he-shorts-one-meme-stock-favorite-11655982864", "content": "Our call of the day comes from AQR Capital Management's Cliff Asness, who sounded off on bonds, value plays and AMC Entertainment."}]}
