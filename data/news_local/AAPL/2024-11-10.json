However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Ronnie Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. \"It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,\" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of \"hold[ing] a grudge\" or being \"very vindictive.\" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they \"stand to gain\" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains \"so uncertain\" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.
