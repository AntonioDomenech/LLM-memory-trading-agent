big US stocks dominating markets and investors’ portfolios are soaring. They recently wrapped up another quarterly earnings season, reporting some spectacular results. Yet these huge market-darling companies are still extremely overvalued, deep into dangerous bubble territory. Their incredible mounting euphoria fueled by some parabolic gains can’t last either. So serious imminent downside risks abound.\nAs a lifelong student of the markets, I love earnings seasons. Publicly-traded companies are required to submit comprehensive 10-Q quarterly and 10-K annual reports to the SEC, which are chock full of their latest and best-available hard fundamental data. That illuminates how companies are really faring, cutting through the obscuring fogs of sentiment normally driving stock-price action. This perspective is invaluable.\nWhile 10-Qs have 40-day deadlines after quarter-ends, the way-larger and more-in-depth 10-Ks aren’t required until 60 days out. So just last week Q4 earnings season ended, with the stragglers among the big US stocks publishing their official reports. Last quarter the flagship S&P 500 stock index surged a hefty 11.2% higher to 4,770, leaving all of 2023 with massive 24.2% gains. Were those fundamentally justified?\nTraders either think so or don’t care. So far in 2024, frenzied stock buying has intensified driving the SPX another 7.7% higher at best. In late January it achieved its first record close in 24.5 months, which really supercharged popular greed. That fueled the SPX powering even higher since, attaining 15 record closes in just 30 trading days as of early March. Excited investors have rushed in chasing these fat stock gains.\nAll that left the S&P 500 and many of its dominant component stocks seriously overbought. A week ago the SPX stretched 13.5% above its baseline 200-day moving average. With US stock markets greedy and euphoric, way overbought, and super-overvalued, a major-selloff reckoning is inevitable and looming. Trading at these extremes simultaneously, stock prices need to normalize soon to reflect their underlying fundamentals.\nAs always big US stocks’ latest Q4’23 results are important for gaming stock markets’ likely direction in coming months. For 26 quarters in a row now, I’ve analyzed how the 25 largest US companies that dominate the SPX fared in their latest earnings seasons. These behemoths commanded a stunning near-record 45.6% of the SPX’s total market cap exiting Q4. Their latest-reported key results are detailed in this table.\nEach big US company’s stock symbol is preceded by its ranking change within the S&P 500 over the past year since the end of Q4’22. These symbols are followed by their stocks’ Q4’23 quarter-end weightings in the SPX, along with their enormous market capitalizations then. Market caps’ year-over-year changes are shown, revealing how those stocks performed for investors independent of manipulative stock buybacks.\nThose have been off the charts for years, long fueled by the Fed’s previous zero-interest-rate policy and trillions of dollars of bond monetizations. Stock buybacks are deceptive financial engineering undertaken to artificially boost stock prices and earnings per share, maximizing executives’ huge compensation. Looking at market-cap changes rather than stock-price ones neutralizes some of buybacks’ distorting effects.\nNext comes each of these big US stocks’ quarterly revenues, hard earnings under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, stock buybacks, trailing-twelve-month price-to-earnings ratios, dividends paid, and operating cash flows generated in Q4’23 followed by their year-over-year changes. Fields are left blank if companies hadn’t reported that particular data as of mid-week, or if it doesn’t exist like negative P/E ratios.\nPercentage changes are excluded if they aren’t meaningful, primarily when data shifted from positive to negative or vice-versa. These latest quarterly results are very important for American stock investors, including anyone with retirement accounts, to understand. They illuminate whether US stock markets are fundamentally sound enough to keep powering higher or are threatened with a major correction or bear selloff.\nWhile the SPX includes 500 stocks, lately only the largest Magnificent 7 mega-cap technology ones really matter. Exiting Q4, mighty Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) commanded an astounding 28.4% of the entire SPX’s market capitalization. That equaled this benchmark’s bottom 398 components’ collective weightings. These Mag7 giants exert absolute dominance over stock markets.\nIn 2023, the Mag7’s total market caps skyrocketed 74.4% to $12,095b. That more than tripled the entire SPX’s 24.2% surge. That vast outperformance has left the US stock markets stunningly bifurcated, with nearly all their gains driven by the Mag7. That has forced professional fund managers to increasingly chase mega-cap-tech upside with outsized allocations, or risk their funds’ performances lagging their peers’.\nUnderperform too long in the money-management business, and investors will pull their capital which can quickly strangle and even kill funds. So more and more investment has flooded into the Mag7, amplifying their enormous gains. All day long on CNBC, Wall Street fund managers and analysts argue that this concentrated mega-cap-tech focus is righteous. The big US stocks’ latest Q4 results sure buttressed that case.\nOverall these massive SPX-top-25 companies reported top-line revenues surging 7.3% YoY to an all-time record high of $1,273b. And the Mag7 achieved the lion’s share of that growth, reporting sales surging an outstanding 14.8% YoY to $525b. The next-18-biggest US companies merely enjoyed way-smaller 2.6%-YoY Q4 growth, but that was skewed by my favorite retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST). My family and friends rave about its food.\nMy wife or I brave Costco every week to load up on fresh meat, fruit, vegetables, and bakery goods. The quality and value of Costco food is outstanding, especially in these inflationary times pinching budgets. In one of our circles of friends, mentioning Costco at barbecues is considered a party foul. The reason is that starts people gushing about how awesome Costco is, often derailing other conservations underway.\nCOST was one of the best-performing big US stocks outside of the Mag7 last year, blasting 45.2% higher. That catapulted it into the elite ranks of the SPX top 25. Costco’s Q4 revenues climbed 6.2% YoY to a hefty $57.8b. That displaced pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which saw its Q4 sales crater 41.3% YoY to $14.2b as COVID-19 hysteria continues fading. Without that swap, next-18-biggest sales actually fell 3.4% YoY.\nBack to the Mag7, AI-chip-selling market-darling NVIDIA reported the most-extreme revenues growth ever seen in a big US stock. NVDA’s Q4 sales skyrocketed an astounding 265.3% YoY to $22.1b, on soaring demand for its flagship H100 graphics processing units used extensively in large-language-model and generative artificial intelligence. NVIDIA has Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing produce these in Taiwan.\nSince demand is so high from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon ramping their cloud AI infrastructure as fast as they can, NVIDIA can sell H100s at epic premiums. Wall Street analysts have estimated H100s cost NVIDIA about $3k to $4k each to manufacture, but can be sold from $25k to $40k. So the getting has sure been good, but such extreme margins can’t last long since they attract big competition.\nNVDA’s AI offerings are essentially upscaled chips used in high-end consumer-PC-gaming GPUs. Other chipmakers are racing to modify their products to excel in AI’s enormous parallel processing. Even some hyperscalers are designing their own AI chips. So demand for H100s will wane as initial AI buildouts are finished, and future generations of NVIDIA’s AI chips certainly won’t command such crazy gold-rush margins.\nNot only did the SPX-top-25 stocks’ revenues only grow last quarter because of the Mag7’s dominance, but big US stocks’ earnings look worse. Those beloved mega-cap-tech giants’ Q4 profits rocketed up an epic 73.4% YoY to $121.5b. While all the Mag7 posted great results with the exception of Apple’s slowing growth, NVIDIA again led the earnings surge. Its profits soared a moonshot 768.8% YoY to $12.3b last quarter.\nNVDA’s gross margins ran a shocking 76.0% in Q4’23, off-the-charts high for any big company. For comparison Costco’s cutthroat grocery business had 3.4% gross margins. COST exists to pass along its big wholesale-buying savings to its members, and membership fees accounted for 68.1% of Costco’s small $1.6b of earnings last quarter. NVIDIA is a huge anomaly thanks to this manic rush to build out AI models.\nThe next-18-biggest US stocks actually saw Q4 earnings slide 2.4% YoY to $96.6b. That is an ominous portent for US consumer spending which is necessary to drive corporate profits. The more inflation bites into Americans’ strained budgets, the less discretionary spending they can do. The SPX top 25 produce plenty of great goods and services we want, but also plenty we don’t need or could easily live with less of.\nActually corporate profitability outside of that Mag7 aberration is much worse thanks to Warren Buffett’s gigantic Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) investment conglomerate. Accounting rules force it to flush unrealized stock gains and losses from its vast holdings through its income statement each quarter. This drives Buffett crazy, he often rails against resulting vast artificial volatility in BRK’s profits. Q4’s unrealized gains were huge.\nWith the SPX surging 11.2%, Berkshire reported a staggering $36.8b of “Investment and derivative contract gains” in Q4’23 which funneled directly into its bottom-line earnings. Without those, BRK’s profits last quarter crater from $37.6b to just $0.8b. Adjust out the comparable Q4’22’s unrealized gains, and those normal operating profits from Berkshire’s vast stable of companies actually plunged 79.0% YoY.\nSince Warren Buffett has invested in such a broad array of companies, BRK’s operating performance probably tracks the US economy more closely than any other big US stock’s. Backing out those huge unrealized stock gains from Berkshire’s Q4’23 and Q4’22 results, that drags down the entire next-18-biggest SPX companies’ Q4 earnings to just $60.5b. That’s actually down a quite-shocking 31.3% YoY.\nThe oil supermajors Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) accounted for a sizable chunk of that, with their total profits plunging 48.2% YoY to $9.9b. Those earnings are highly leveraged to oil prices, and benchmark US crude’s average fell 4.9% YoY to $78.63 per barrel across those quarters. But even if XOM and CVX earnings had held steady, without BRK’s unrealized gains the next-18-biggest stocks’ earnings fell 20.8% YoY.\nExcluding the Mag7 phenomenon, corporate profits are dropping as Americans face increasing budget pressures. Prices are way higher for things we have to buy like food, shelter, insurance, and medical expenses. That leaves less money to buy big US corporations’ many other goods and services. And if earnings are deteriorating, should the S&P 500 be way up at record highs? There’s a gaping disconnect here.\nAnd despite their spectacular Q4 results, even the Mag7 aren’t immune from less money to spend. While mighty Apple eked out 2.1%-YoY sales growth last quarter, the preceding Q3’23 was the fourth quarter in a row its top-line revenues declined annually. iPhones last much longer than Apple’s yearly releases, so people can easily delay upgrades a few years. Ironically Amazon is facing mounting competition from China.\nRather than buying Chinese-produced consumer goods from Amazon, an upstart website Temu is selling them to Americans directly from Chinese factories at way-lower costs. That cuts out Amazon and its middlemen, saving lots of money on the same Chinese goods. Temu’s popularity is exploding as Americans become aware of it, including from Super Bowl commercials. My wife and her friends rave about it.\nAlphabet and Meta rely almost exclusively on advertising from businesses. But as consumer spending slows hitting profitability, advertising spends are the first thing scaled back. That is true for these biggest US stocks advertising on the Super Bowl down to small businesses buying Google search ads. Even Tesla’s growth is in jeopardy as demand for expensive battery cars has been weakening with consumer spending.\nSo while the Magnificent 7 mega-cap techs’ sales and profits have been spectacular, they certainly aren’t immune from slowing sharply or even falling. This is a serious risk to stock markets totally dependent on ever-increasing capital inflows into this handful of already-absurdly-humongous stocks. This writing on the wall is probably understood by Mag7 upper managements. Even they are growing more conservative lately.\nOne big reason the Mag7 stocks have soared so high and long is their massive stock buybacks fueled by their huge profitability. Back in Q4’22, those ran $48.4b which was 69.1% of quarterly earnings. Yet in Q4’23 as profits skyrocketed 73.4% YoY to $121.5b, the Mag7 kept their stock buybacks flat at $48.9b making for just 40.3% of profits. Why hoard cash unless managements fear these gravy days are numbered?\nWhile the SPX-top-25 stocks put up fantastic Q4 results thanks to the mega-cap-tech market-darlings, these lofty stock markets are still far too expensive. Their average trailing-twelve-month price-to-earnings ratios exiting Q4’23 ran 38.2x, deep into dangerous bubble territory that starts at 28x. Historically over the last century-and-a-half or so, big US stocks have averaged 14x fair-value P/Es and bubbles start at twice that.\nAnd despite their colossal revenues and earnings and great ongoing growth, the Mag7 stocks remain way more overvalued than other big US stocks. They averaged crazy 50.5x P/Es leaving Q4, which soared 55.4% YoY from the end of Q4’22. That means nearly 3/4ths of mega-cap techs’ 74.4% market-cap gains didn’t result from better fundamentals, but multiple expansion. Historically bubble valuations never last long.\nStock prices must ultimately reflect some reasonable multiple of their underlying corporate earnings. So paying too much for any stock near record highs radically increases odds of suffering subsequent losses as it inevitably mean reverts lower. Imagine finding a great house on a nice street with similar $500k homes, but then paying $1,000k+ for it.

Markets\n\nPublished03/08/2024, 03:34 PM\n\nIs It Time to Sell These 5 Overvalued Stocks?\n\nView all comments (5)5\n\nMarketBeat.com\nArticles(5360)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nDELL\n-0.26%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nLUV\n-0.19%\n\nCELH\n-0.17%\n\nWING\n-3.16%\n\nVST\n2.77%\n\nWingstop, Celsius, Southwest Airlines, Vistra and Dell have all shown fundamental and technical strength, but pullbacks wouldn't be surprising.\nWhen facing an overvalued stock, long-term investors may choose to hold if they trust the underlying fundamentals.\nHowever, short-term traders might sell overvalued stocks and wait for a better entry point.\nAs Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to lead the S&P 500 higher, even as other big techs such as Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pull back sharply, some investors are wondering whether Nvidia stock may be overvalued.\nWhile Nvidia is the most prominent stock in this market cycle, other recent winners are also getting scrutiny as they’ve raced higher, with some analysts believing they’re due for a pullback soon.\nWingstop Inc, Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH), Southwest Airlines Co., Vistra Corp. and Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) have all staged strong rallies, often a signal that big investors are ready to take some profits.\nHow to Handle an Overvalued Stock\nThose holding a stock that appears to be overvalued have a few ways to proceed, depending on their time horizon. Long-term investors might opt to hold onto the stock if they believe in its underlying fundamentals, while short-term traders might consider selling and waiting for a more favorable entry point to get back in.\nThe latter approach takes opportunity cost into account; rather than sitting through a pullback, proceeds from a sale can be deployed elsewhere. In the current market, even a high-yield savings account can be a place to park cash and get a solid return.\nWill Wingstop’s Wings Soon be Clipped? \nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) shares are up 50% in the past three months, with the stock working on its seventh month in a row of upside price action.\nThe mid-cap is a leader among restaurant stocks, and its price-to-earnings ratio of 147 reflects that fast pace of growth. Wingstop earnings have been increasing at double-digit rates since 2020, and analysts expect that trend to continue this year and next.\nHowever, the Wingstop chart offers a clue about possible ways handle this stock.\nWhen a stock is extended well above moving averages, as Wingstop is, investors might consider selling or reducing exposure to mitigate potential losses.\nCan Celsius Holdings Maintain Energy Levels?\nThe Celsius Holdings chart shows the energy drink maker advancing 66.79% in the past three months. Celsius stock has returned 28.45% in the past week after the company’s better-than-expected earnings report on February 29.\nMarketBeat’s Celsius analyst forecasts show a consensus view of “moderate buy,” with a price target of $76.13. That’s a downside of 13.21%, an indication that the stock is ready for a pullback after such a fast upward trajectory.\nThat’s perfectly normal, as institutional investors frequently take profits after a big run-up, even if they simply pare back positions to rebalance their portfolios.\nIs Southwest Airlines Reaching Cruising Altitude?\nThe Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) chart shows the stock breaking out of a steep cup-with-handle base with a 45% peak-to-trough correction.\nWith that correction, the stock even undercut its May 2020 pandemic-era low.\nAs it worked on the right side of its most recent base, Southwest stock rallied back 27.97% in the past three months. It’s not unusual, after a rally of that size, for a stock to see a pullback.\nIn a March 2 note, CFRA analyst Jonathan Handshoe dropped his rating to “hold” from “buy,” saying, “While domestic travel has seen significant improvement since the Covid-19 pandemic, we think LUV could face significant headwinds as international travel has outpaced domestic travel in 2023, and we believe that will be the case heading into 2024.”\nVistra Ready to Power Down?\nUtilities stocks aren’t typically among the market’s biggest leaders, but that’s exactly where Vistra sits right now, outperforming the broad market by a wide margin.\nThe Vistra chart shows the stock advancing 58.16% in the past three months. Vistra stock is currently trading at lofty levels, 13.2% above its short-term 10-day moving average\nVistra’s dividend yield is 1.4%, relatively low by utility-sector standards, but that’s partly due to its fast share-price uptrend. The company has also returned capital to shareholders via share buybacks, which contribute to price increases.\nVistra analyst forecasts show a consensus rating of “buy,” but notice the price target of $46, a downside of 24.05%. Despite this stock having a lot going for it, that rapid price appreciation can’t last forever.\nCan Dell Keep Soaring on AI-Driven Earnings \nDell stock has pulled back since a 32% gap higher on March 1, following upbeat fourth-quarter results.\nEarnings came in at $2.46 a share, a 12% year-over-year increase. Revenue of $25 billion also Marked an increase of 12%.\nIn a March 1 note, Morningstar analyst William Kerwin raised his fair value estimate on Dell to $55 from $46. However, that still implies a forecast of a significant pullback, as Dell stock is currently trading at around $120.\nKerwin wrote, “Dell holds top market shares across its businesses, but these are predominantly commoditized, cyclical, and price-competitive markets that, in our view, don’t endow a leader like Dell with an economic moat. We forecast Dell to see no more than modest top-line growth into the medium- and long-term, and see little opportunity for material and durable margin expansion.”\nOriginal Post\n\nIs It Time to Sell These 5 Overvalued Stocks?\n\nView all comments (5)5\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,930.00\n+95.8\n+0.21%\n\nUS 500 \n6,587.90\n+3.6\n+0.05%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.20\n+0.44\n+2.98%\n\nDollar Index \n97.13\n-0.016\n-0.02%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.88\n+0.19\n+0.30%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.14\n+0.15\n+0.22%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.958\n+0.017\n+0.58%\n\nGold Futures\n3,681.80\n-4.60\n-0.12%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.66\n-0.170\n-0.40%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.649\n-0.0030\n-0.06%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.63\n-5.38\n-0.51%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.063\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.04\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.27\n-0.02\n-0.01%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.79\n-0.09\n-0.07%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

Here are the details:\n\nNon-farm payrolls came at 275K vs 195K consensus. This indicates that the job growth is a lot stronger than expected.\nNonfarm private payrolls came at 223K vs 150K consensus. This indicates that the job growth is strong in the private sector.\nUnemployment rate came at 3.9% vs 3.7% consensus. This indicates that while the job growth is strong unemployment is rising.\nAverage hourly earnings came at 0.1% vs 0.3% consensus.  In The Arora Report analysis, this is the most important data point for investors. This data indicates that hourly wages are rising at the rate of 1.2% annualized. This is much lower than what workers would like but is great for the profits of corporations and also for curbing inflation. This data point is positive for the stock market.\nAverage work week came at 34.3 vs 34.3 consensus.\n\n\nThe forgoing data is such that the analysts can convincingly make a case for all three of the following depending on personal bias:\n\nNo landing\nSoft landing\nRecession\n\n\nMomo gurus are already out claiming that the Jobs Report shows no landing and as a result the stock market is going to go much higher.\nThe record shows that momo gurus are usually wrong but prudent investors need to pay attention to them because the momo crowd follows these ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"}, {"title": "Investors have sold a record amount of tech stocks, says Bank of America", "source": {"name": "MarketWatch", "homepage_url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/marketwatch.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/marketwatch.ico"}, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-have-drained-4-4-billion-from-tech-stocks-the-most-ever-says-bank-of-america-c3185d79", "content": "While investors remain under the spell of tech companies catering to AI, a record amount of selling appears to have hit the overall sector in recent days."}, {"title": "Nvidia Vs.

But then, by the end of the after hours session at 8:00 PM ET, the stock closed above $946. That’s a 3.5% swing in after hours trading, adding $80 billion in market cap.
