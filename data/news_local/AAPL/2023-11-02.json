(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded estimates Thursday, with better-than-expected Services and iPad revenue. The company’s Services revenue rose to a record and so did its active installed base of devices, while iPhone revenue was slightly shy of estimates. \nApple’s Key Q4 Metrics: Cupertino, California-based Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.46 per share, ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.39 per share.

The top line came in at $89.5 billion compared to the $90.15 billion the tech giant reported a year ago and the $81.8 billion in revenue in the preceding quarter.\nAnalysts, on average, expected revenue of $89.28 billion.\nAhead of the results, Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring said Apple would likely report in line to better-than-expected September quarter results thanks to mid-single-digit year-over-year iPhone revenue growth and accelerating Services revenue growth.\nThe fourth-quarter gross margin was at  45.17% compared to the guidance of 44%-45%.
