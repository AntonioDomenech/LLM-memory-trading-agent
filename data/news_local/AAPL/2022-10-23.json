tech earnings, Q3 GDP data, PCE inflation in focus\nExxon Mobil stock is a buy with strong earnings coming up\nShopify is set to struggle amid slowing sales growth, weak outlook\nStocks on Wall Street closed sharply higher on Friday, while Treasury yields collapsed after a report said the Federal Reserve might consider less aggressive rate hikes after November.\nAll three major indexes notched their biggest weekly percentage gains since June, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing out the week 5.2% higher. The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 4.7%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.9%.\n\nThe coming week is expected to be another eventful one as markets continue to weigh the Fed’s rate hike plans for the months ahead.\nMeanwhile, Q3 earnings season kicks into high gear, with reports expected from the mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\nThe earnings agenda also consists of other high-profile companies, such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\nIn addition, there is also important third-quarter growth data due on Thursday, which will provide more clues as to whether the economy is heading for recession. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure - then comes out Friday morning.\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below we highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see further downside.\nRemember though, our timeframe is just for the upcoming week.\nStock To Buy: Exxon Mobil\nI expect Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) to put in a strong performance this week, with shares likely to break out to fresh all-time highs, as the largest U.S. oil company is forecast to deliver explosive earnings and revenue growth when it releases its latest financial results ahead of the opening bell on Friday, Oct. 28.\nAs per moves in the options market, traders are pricing in a possible swing of roughly 6% in either direction for XOM stock following the earnings update.\nConsensus estimates call for the Irving, Texas-based energy giant to post third-quarter earnings per share of $3.67, soaring 132.2% from the year-ago period. Revenue is forecast to jump 45.3% year-over-year to $107.2 billion, as the oil-and-gas producer benefits from improving energy market fundamentals and robust commodity prices.\n\nI believe Exxon’s management will boost its profit and sales guidance for the months ahead as well as lifting its outlook for free cash flow in order to reflect the positive impact of skyrocketing crude oil and natural gas prices on its business.\nAs such, market players will be curious to hear if the thriving energy company plans to return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividend payouts and stock buybacks.\nExxon’s board previously boosted its share repurchase program to up to $30 billion through 2023, up from its prior plan to buy back $10 billion in stock. The oil-and-gas behemoth currently offers a quarterly payout of $0.88 per share, which implies an annualized dividend of $3.52 at a yield of 3.85%.\n\nXOM stock, which has outperformed the broader market by a wide margin this year, hit $106.40 on Friday before closing at $105.86, above the prior record high close of $104.59 from June 8.\nYear-to-date, shares have increased a whopping 73%, blowing past the gains made by competitors Chevron (NYSE:CVX) (+47.6%), Shell (LON:RDSa) (22.1%), and BP (NYSE:BP) (+17.7%) over the same timeframe.\nAt current levels, Exxon has a market cap of $441.2 billion, making it the tenth highest valued public company in the world.\nStock To Dump: Shopify\nIn my view, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock - which recently sank to its lowest level since April 2019 - could suffer another disappointing week as investors brace for weak financial results from the beleaguered online marketplace platform provider, which are likely to reveal another quarterly loss as well as slowing revenue growth.\nAccording to Investing.com, Shopify is forecast to report a loss of $0.06 per share for the third quarter, compared to a profit of $0.81 in the same quarter last year. If confirmed, it would mark the second straight quarterly loss and the biggest since Q3 2019.\nRevenue is expected to increase 19.6% from the year-ago period to $1.34 billion, as the e-commerce company struggles with the ongoing impact of worsening fundamentals and a tough macroeconomic environment of rising interest rates and soaring inflation.\n\nThe dismal results will likely lead Shopify’s management to cut guidance amid another sluggish performance in its core e-commerce business, which will fuel further concerns about growth prospects in a post-pandemic world.\nMarket players expect a sizable swing in SHOP shares following the results, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of about 12% in either direction.\nSHOP’s Q3 results are due ahead of the opening bell on Thursday, Oct. 27.\n\nSHOP stock - which split 10-for-1 earlier this year - ended at $29.75 on Friday. It fell to a more than three-year low of $23.63 on Oct. 13.\nAt current levels, the Ottawa, Canada-based e-commerce specialist - which helps merchants set up online retail shops and manage their brands - has a market cap of $37.8 billion.\nShopify has seen its valuation collapse throughout 2022, with shares sinking 78.4% year-to-date. Even more alarming, SHOP has now pulled back almost 83% since touching a split-adjusted record high of $176 in November 2021.\nDisclosure:At the time of writing, Jesse is long on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq via the SPDRS&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ).

Markets\n\nPublished10/23/2022, 07:03 AM\n\nApple Headlines A Big Earnings Week, iPhone Still The Driver For Optimism\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nHaris Anwar\nArticles(1312)\n\nFollow\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nApple, the heaviest weighted company in the S&P 500, reports earnings this Thursday\nApple warned earlier this year that the second half could be rough due to supply-chain hurdles\nDue to strong iPhone demand, analysts are upbeat about the company’s growth prospects\nIn a week packed with earnings reports from some of the most-valued public companies, the latest numbers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are crucial to get insight into an array of themes affecting the market, such as consumer demand, supply chains, the effect of the soaring USD dollar and higher interest rates.\nThe iPhone maker, which has the heaviest weighting on the S&P 500, is scheduled to report on Thursday, Oct. 27, after the market close.\nAccording to analysts’ consensus estimates compiled by Investing.com, the company’s sales for the quarter ended on Sept. 30 are expected to have expanded 6% to $88.76 billion when compared with the same period a year ago. The earnings per share are expected to remain roughly flat at $1.27.\nApple warned earlier this year that the second half of this year could prove rough due to supply chain hurdles and the weakening demand from China and Europe. But these headwinds, so far, haven’t caused the damage as big as earlier anticipated.\nApple Earnings History\n\nSource: Investing.com\nThis year, Apple introduced the iPhone 14, new AirPods Pro earbuds, and new Apple Watch models. The latest pre-order data showed that the iPhone 14 Pro Max was the best-selling model, surpassing what the older version did in a similar timeframe.\nDue to Apple’s product strength, the analyst community is generally upbeat about Apple’s growth prospects. According to InvestingPro data, there has been only 4% downward revision in the company’s EPS estimates during the past 90 days.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nThe major driver of this optimism is Apple's wealthy and loyal consumer base, in theory, more resilient to macroeconomic headwinds. During the previous quarter, Apple’s iPhone and iPad both performed better than feared, while other products -- including Macs and wearables -- fell short of analysts’ projections. Services, a key growth area for Apple, also showed some weakness.\nStill, there are some signs that the current challenging conditions are hampering growth for Apple’s flagship iPhones. The company is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, Bloomberg reported last month.\n“The Cupertino, California-based electronics maker has told suppliers to pull back from efforts to increase assembly of the iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year,” the report said citing sources.\nGlobal demand for personal electronics has also been suppressed by surging inflation, recession fears and disruption from the war in Ukraine. The smartphone market is expected to shrink by 6.5% this year to 1.27 billion units, according to data from market tracker IDC.\nBottom Line\nApple earnings may show some slowdown in demand when it reports later this week. But the market isn’t expecting any major negative surprise.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author was long on Apple stock.

Think about the challenges:\nInflation\nGeopolitical turmoil\nDisruptive technologies\nInterest rate hikes\nTo handle them, you need good data, effective tools to sort through the data, and insights into what it all means. You need to take emotion out of investing and focus on the fundamentals.\nFor that, there’s InvestingPro+, with all the professional data and tools you need to make better investing decisions.
