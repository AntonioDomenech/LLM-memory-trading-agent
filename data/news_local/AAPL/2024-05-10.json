markets, marked by a dearth of major economic news and a consistent flow of positive indicators from the first-quarter earnings season.\nAs of May 7, 424 companies in the S&P 500 have disclosed their earnings, with 78% surpassing earnings expectations and 61% exceeding revenue forecasts.\nThe S&P 500 continued its upward trend, marking its third consecutive week of gains and nearly recouping losses from April, while the Dow Jones boasted eight consecutive sessions in the green.\nNotably, the utilities sector, as tracked by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), has emerged as the star performer of 2024, outstripping energy and doubling the tech sector’s performance, with some analysts attributing the outperformance to heightened ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"},

to know today.\n\nBuying On Rising Layoffs\nPlease click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).\nNote the following:\n\nThe chart shows that the stock market has vigorously risen from the recent pullback.\nThe chart shows that RSI reached oversold levels during the recent pullback and now has risen to touch the lower band of the overbought zone.  Historically, this setup leads to more stock market gains.\nThe chart shows that the volume during the recent rise is not heavy.  This indicates lack of conviction.\nThe chart shows that the stock market is now in the resistance zone.\nIn The Arora Report analysis, stops of the short sellers are right above the resistance zone.  If the stock market rises further, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will kick in, taking out the stops of short sellers and igniting a short squeeze. The result of such a scenario would be a new stock market high.  \nYesterday in the Morning Capsule we shared with you:\n\nJobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.\n\n\nThe bulls latched on to the rise in jobless claims and aggressively bought stocks. There is merit to this line of thinking because Powell is already itching to cut rates and rising layoffs will give him an excuse to cut rates.\nPrudent investors need to be somewhat careful as weekly jobless claims series is very volatile.\nFor proper analysis at The Arora Report, in addition to the weekly data, we look at a four week moving average of initial jobless claims.  The four week moving average is now at 215K – up 2.26% from the prior week and down 10.14% from a year ago.  Considering the size of the U.S. economy, a rise of 2.26% over the prior week is hardly meaningful, but do not tell that to trigger happy stock market bulls.  Prudent investors should watch the trend over a period of several weeks, not just one week. Jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in The Arora Report adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"}, {"title": "5
