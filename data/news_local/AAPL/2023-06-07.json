Here’s a look at the news on Lionel Messi and his decision.\nWhat Happened: Messi is set to join Inter Miami, a team in Major League Soccer, after rumors previously linked him to returning to FC Barcelona or joining Cristiano Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia.\nMiami has been interested in Messi for years, with talk of a move linked to the MLS team gaining steam in November 2022.\nMessi rejected a deal with Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal that would have paid him more than Inter Miami, according to the BBC. \nA World Cub winner and seven-time Ballon d’Or winner, Messi is considered one of the best soccer players of all time and one of the current best in the world.\nMessi owns a home in Miami, a factor that may have played into his decision to join the MLS team.\nInter Miami is owned by soccer legend David Beckham, who also previously made a big move from Europe to the United States. Messi’s friendship with Beckham could have been another factor in the soccer player’s decision.\n“Who knows, maybe in a few years you can give me a ring,” Messi shared on social media in 2018 when the Miami expansion team was announced by Beckham.\nThe Athletic reported that Messi’s deal could also include an option to purchase a percentage of an MLS team after he is done playing the league. Beckham received a similar deal when he played in the MLS, which led to him later buying the expansion Miami team.\nApple And Adidas Rumored Involvement: Another key factor that likely played into Messi’s decision was the involvement of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n“The league has gotten very creative with all of this,” a MLS stakeholder said on Tuesday morning, as reported by The Athletic. “Everything is on the table.”\nAmong the items that were discussed: Apple offering Messi a share of the revenue from new subscribers that sign up for the MLS Season Pass, a streaming package offered on AppleTV+.\n“Both ..."}, {"title": "Stock Market Stumbles After Double Top Signal: Investor Anxiety Grows Over Potential Fed Rate Hike", "source": {"name": "Benzinga", "homepage_url": "https://www.benzinga.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"}, "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/23/06/32754564/us-stocks-set-to-open-flat-as-uncertainty-prevails-analyst-says-makes-sense-to-be-a-bit-careful-her", "content": "The stock market was pulling back on Wednesday, with both the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq 100 index failing to eclipse Monday's highs, forming a so-called technical double top which may indicate investors are starting to take some risk off the table ahead of next week's inflation data and FOMC Meeting.\nTraders reassessed their expectations on Fed policy, and now assign a 35% chance of a rate hike in June, up from Tuesday's 21%.
