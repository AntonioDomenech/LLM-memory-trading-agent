These past few months have been good to them though, and heading into the last quarter of the year they're up about 35% from the multi-year lows they hit in May and June. This kind of multi-month plummet may have ruled them out from ever again being compared to the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as they were when included in the FAANG group, but that's not to say there still isn't an opportunity for retail investors to capitalize. \nRecent comments from Morgan Stanley, though not overwhelmingly bullish, were decidedly not bearish, and this can often be the first sign that a trend reversal is in the making. Just last week the team there reiterated their Equal Weight rating Netflix shares, saying they seem to be trading around fair value right now, though some concerns remain about whether the company can achieve their 2023 subscriber goals. It's been not only the sharp slowdown in these subscriber numbers, but the actual decline of them that's fuelled much of the selling over the past year.

The disappointing unveiling led to Apple's stock retreating during market hours by close to 1%. Meanwhile, Apple is down close to 4% during Tuesday's trading hours, as a hotter than expected inflation weighed on the markets.\nThe iPhone 14 has been priced at $799, meanwhile, the iPhone 13 has been discounted to $699. Apple killed the iPhone mini, and instead now has two main models a 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and 6.7 inches iPhone 14 plus. Apple has introduced a number of new features for the latest phone including the addition of satellite connection capabilities, the addition of eSim capabilities, 8k video capture, and the new A16 chips. Apple's fans won't be overly impressed, but considering the stickiness of the product, expect the phone to continue dominating sales.\niPhone 13 continued to dominate throughout last year, and despite similar commentary about a lack of improvement last year, the phone beat all expectations and push itself into second place behind Samsung in terms of market share. iPhone 14 may see similar improvements and Apple's decision not to hike ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"}]}
