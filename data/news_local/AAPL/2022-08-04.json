Markets\n\nPublished08/04/2022, 09:48 AM\n\nTensions: What Will It Mean For Mid-Caps, Small-Caps, Tech, Crude And Crypto\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nTim Knight\nArticles(4241)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nESZ25\n0.16%\n\nCL\n0.59%\n\nNQZ25\n0.15%\n\nBitcoin US Dollar\n0.24%\n\nEthereum US Dollar\n-0.93%\n\nTomorrow morning, Friday, will be the monthly jobs report, but there’s almost nothing in the way of news driving the market this morning. Thus, everything is just gently drifting higher. Here we see the ES has maintained the breakout is achieved yesterday. A failure of this level, about 4147, would be a minor piece of bad news for the bulls, but it hasn’t happened yet.\n\nA larger bullish base can be seen by way of the Nasdaq 100 Futures. On the one hand, this is, in fact, a well-formed bullish base that would indicate the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have nothing but blue sky ahead. On the other hand, there is a staggering amount of overhead supply, which will suppress any easy price growth. In other words, the breezy part of the ascent is already over.\n\nThe strongest market lately has been small caps. But to my way of thinking, it has reached a point of at least temporary exhaustion.\n\nThere are two asset classes I believe post the most risk for assets in general: crude oil and crypto. For crude oil, a failure just below 90 would accelerate the selling. This shelf of support has been in place for an exceptionally long time.\n\nCrypto in general, and Bitcoin and Ethereum, in particular, have been sputtering lately. The breakout that Ethereum experienced was quite short-lived.\n\nToday could be one of those drab “meandering” days in which it’s hardly even worth coming in, unless we get a failure of any of those horizontals I mentioned.\n\nTensions: What Will It Mean For Mid-Caps, Small-Caps, Tech, Crude And Crypto\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,909.50\n+75.3\n+0.16%\n\nUS 500 \n6,596.30\n+12.0\n+0.18%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.07\n+0.31\n+2.10%\n\nDollar Index \n97.11\n-0.036\n-0.04%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.79\n+0.10\n+0.16%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.33\n+0.34\n+0.51%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.973\n+0.032\n+1.09%\n\nGold Futures\n3,678.70\n-7.70\n-0.21%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.708\n-0.122\n-0.29%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6645\n+0.0125\n+0.27%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,045.38\n-0.88\n-0.08%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.077\n+0.018\n+0.44%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.696\n+0.017\n+0.36%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.633\n+0.008\n+0.22%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.20\n-0.08\n-0.07%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.68\n-0.20\n-0.16%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
