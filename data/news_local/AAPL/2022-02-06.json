Bloomberg columnist and an Apple expert, Mark Gurman, however, feels the company may navigate through the issue without much of a hit.\nHow App Store Changes Will Impact Apple:  Some lawmakers, who wield political clout, are clamoring to pass a bill in Congress that, if enacted, will deprive Apple of billions of dollars per year and also push the App Store to the brink, Gurman noted.\nThe two bills that will likely have implication for Apple's App Store are the \"Open App Markets Act\" ..."}, {"title": "How Real Estate Agents Can Benefit From The Metaverse", "source": "Benzinga", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/02/25441049/how-real-estate-agents-can-benefit-from-the-metaverse", "content": "BY DANIEL HOUSTON, originally published on Inman.\nIn recent years, James Harris says he’s become increasingly fascinated by cryptocurrency technology — and the virtual worlds it has inspired.\nNow, Harris, one of the stars of the reality TV series Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, is one of a small but growing group of luxury real estate brokers making an early play in the world of metaverse real estate. In these metaverses, digital “land” can be bought, sold and developed entirely within a virtual world.\n“You want to be part of something new,” Harris, a luxury broker at The Agency, told Inman. “You want to be part of something that’s revolutionary. And this is revolutionary. We’re in this so early right now.”\nHarris and other brokers Inman spoke with for this story warn that this is not a space for agents to jump into carelessly. Scams and opportunities to make underinformed investment decisions are among the risks agents face, they said. But if these platforms take off, the early adopters could win big.\nMetaverses have been in development for some time, including the blockchain-fueled worlds of The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND) and Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA). But these cryptocurrency-based environments are also facing competition from big tech companies. Public interest in metaverses surged in October after Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta and investing further in its own virtual-world experience.\nIn the long run, a potential rise in metaverse popularity could create opportunities for a new kind of agent — a virtual real estate broker to help buyers and sellers navigate the process safely and make a well informed virtual transaction.\nBut for a typical agent, those days are likely still a long way off. The most prominent agents in virtual real estate today have been partnering with metaverse developers to design and market properties. Some of them are also investing in virtual land themselves.\nHere’s what they have to say about this complex new frontier, and where it might be heading.\nRelated: How To Invest In The Metaverse\nWhat is a metaverse?\n \nIf you’re confused by what a metaverse is, you’re not alone. There’s a whole array of metaverses out there, and each one has a different set of offerings for its users.\nA metaverse is a 3D online world where users can interact, hang out and, in some cases, own their own corner of the virtual landscape. Think like a social network, but more immersive.\nThese metaverses can be explored on a computer or mobile device, and even traversed with special virtual reality hardware.\nWhile the prospect of buying and selling real estate on these platforms is only beginning to gain attention, the social and professional aspects of metaverses are not new to the real estate industry.\nThe World of eXp Realty is one such virtual reality environment.\nIn a January conversation with Inman Group Founder Brad Inman, eXp Founder and CEO Glenn Sanford said his company rolled out the World platform as a means for his all-remote network of real estate agents to engage with each other in ways that are normally done in an office setting.\nBut the World, Sanford said, was also an opportunity for eXp to increase its profile in the eyes of agents and the public at large.\n“The reason why we did a virtual world in the beginning was because we wanted a unique selling proposition that somebody would talk about,” Sanford said at the Connect Now virtual session. “Something that was different enough that it would be remarkable — remarkable meaning that people would talk about it.”\nSanford anticipates that more workplaces — within and outside ..."}, {"title": "10 Most Searched Tickers On Benzinga In January: SPY, Tesla, Apple And More", "source": "Benzinga", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/02/25398861/10-most-searched-tickers-on-benzinga-in-january-spy-tesla-apple-and-more", "content": "Each trading day features hundreds of headlines and press releases about companies.
