D-Wave (QBTS), a quantum computing company, announced it secured $175 million in funding. CEO Alan Baratz joins Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to break down what's going on in the quantum computing space and what investors need to know about its connection to artificial intelligence (AI). \"There's a lot of synergy between AI and quantum,\" Baratz says, adding, \"The way I think about it is that there are three areas in which AI and quantum work together.\" \"The first and most obvious is that each can work side by side to solve a problem synergistically. For example, you might use AI to predict product demand in the future and then use quantum computing to optimize the supply chain to meet that demand.\" \"Second, we are doing a fair amount of work right now on how quantum computing could be used as part of the model training and inference for AI.\" The CEO explains, \"Because of the fact that [quantum is] so much faster than classical [computing] and requires so much less power, we think that we may be able to support model training and inference with much lower power consumption than what's happening today, which could be a game-changer.\" \"Finally, models on quantum distributions rather than classical distributions may allow for more accurate [AI] models.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
