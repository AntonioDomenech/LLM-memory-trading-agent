Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an area that focuses on enabling machines and software to process information and make decisions autonomously. Machine learning, a component of AI, involves computer systems enhancing their problem-solving and comprehension of complex issues through automated techniques.\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nThe three central machine-learning methodologies that programmers can use are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. For in-depth information on supervised machine learning and reinforcement machine learning, kindly refer to the articles dedicated to them. Here you can read up on the basics of unsupervised machine learning.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is unsupervised machine learning?\nWith unsupervised machine learning, a system is like a curious toddler exploring a world they know nothing about. The system is exploring data without knowing what it's looking for but is excited -- in a digital kind of way -- about any new pattern it stumbles upon.\nWith this type of machine learning, algorithms sift through heaps of unstructured data without any specific directions or end goals in mind. They are looking for previously unknown patterns, much as you might look for a new stock pick in an overlooked corner of the market. This is rarely the last step since the owner of the raw data typically applies more sophisticated deep learning or supervised machine learning analyses to any potentially interesting patterns.\n\nImplications and intricacies\nThe implications and intricacies of unsupervised learning\nWhy should you care about this artificial intelligence toddler on a quest without a firm goal? Well, unsupervised machine learning is actually on the cutting edge of technology and innovation. Itâ€™s a key player in everything from autonomous vehicles learning to navigate roads to recommendation algorithms on your favorite streaming platforms. This pattern-finding method is a powerful first step in a deep analysis of any complex topic, from weather forecasting to genetic research.\nTwo major types of unsupervised learning are clustering and association.\nClustering is like sorting a pile of random stocks into sectors with some common theme or quality. It's all about grouping similar things together.\nAssociation, on the other hand, is like realizing that smartphone component stocks often rise when Apple (AAPL 1.82%) announces a new iPhone. Itâ€™s about finding relationships and connections between apparently separate things.\n\nHow it's used\nMaking good use of unsupervised machine learning\nSo now you know what unsupervised machine learning is and why it matters. How can you take this newfound knowledge and put it to good use?\nFirst off, you can make informed investment decisions. Companies leveraging unsupervised learning are often poised for growth as this technology continues to evolve. Think about Amazon (AMZN -0.74%) using unsupervised learning for its product recommendations or Netflix (NFLX -1.17%) running unsupervised machine learning routines across years of collected viewership data to generate your streaming home page and make future content production decisions.\nThese applications aren't just fun toys -- they are business advantages and growth drivers.\nAlso, AI and machine learning continue to reshape many industries. Whether you're into FAANG stocks or emerging AI startups, knowledge about unsupervised learning can give you an edge in evaluating a company's tech prowess and potential for future success.\nRelated investing topics\n\n \n Investing in AI Stocks: A Comprehensive Guide to the Future of Technology\n \n \nLearn how you can make money from the wave of seasoned companies innovating in AI and new AI tech companies.\n\n \n 10 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a Compelling Way\n \n \nLearn about how some of the biggest companies in the world are using AI.\n\n \n Investing in Tech Stocks\n \n \nThis vast sector is composed of some of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nSocial media connections\nUnsupervised learning in action: Social media connections\nWe all appreciate a bit of connection, right? Well, thanks to unsupervised machine learning, we're getting better at finding people we might know or like on social media platforms. Facebook is a prime example.\nHave you ever wondered how Facebook seems to know who your actual friends from high school are -- the ones you may actually want to keep in touch with? It's not sorcery. It's unsupervised learning in action.\nMeta Platforms' (META 0.7%) massive social network continually analyzes a trove of user data, looking for patterns and shared features among users. Common friends are a helpful clue; similar locations and shared interests can point the platform in the right direction, and mutual workplaces can be the clincher. None of these qualities is enough in itself to find that long-lost flame or forgotten friend, but they add up through the power of unsupervised machine-learning algorithms.\nSo when Facebook suggests \"People You May Know,\" it essentially gives you the output of an unsupervised learning model. The social network isn't just pulling these suggestions out of a digital hat. Each one is the result of a complex analysis of patterns and connections.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n \n Anders Bylund is a contributing Motley Fool media and technology analyst covering semiconductors, cloud computing, internet infrastructure, quantum computing, and streaming media.

However, there are other ways to buy stocks, and using a buy limit order is a common alternative.\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nWhat is a buy limit order?\nWhat is a buy limit order?\nA buy limit order is an order that instructs your broker to buy a stock or other security only at a specific maximum price. In other words, if you enter a buy limit order for 100 shares at $20, that is the absolute highest price at which the order can be executed. If the stock is not available at $20 or less, you simply will not buy any shares.\nThere also can be a sell limit order, which sets the lowest allowable price at which you're willing to sell a security. Collectively, buy and sell orders placed with limits are simply known as \"limit orders.\"\nIt's also worth noting that you can usually set time limits on buy limit orders. You may have the option of using a buy limit order that expires at the end of the trading day or one in effect until you decide to cancel it (known as \"good until canceled,\" or GTC).\n\nWhy use a buy limit order?\nWhy use a buy limit order?\nObviously, the biggest advantage of using a buy limit order is that you can avoid overpaying for a stock. For example, if your analysis shows that $18 is an attractive price for a stock and it is currently trading at $20, you can set a buy limit order for $18 that will be filled if and when the price comes down.\nHowever, buy limit orders have drawbacks as well. For one thing, they aren't always executed. So if you really want to own a stock, a buy limit order might not be the best choice. There's also the possibility that you could end up with an unfavorable price if a stock is plunging.\nFor example, let's say a stock is trading at $50 and you have a buy limit order for $48. Then, news claiming the company is being investigated for fraud is released and the stock plunges to $30 in a matter of minutes. Because your buy limit order gives your broker permission to pull the trigger at any price of $48 or less, you could end up paying more than if you had simply let the market volatility play out.\n\n Stock Market Volatility\n \nStock market volatility is a measure of how much the stock market's overall value fluctuates up and down.\n\nShould you use a buy limit order when you buy stocks?\nShould you use a buy limit order when you buy stocks?\nIf you're a long-term investor and simply want to own shares of a particular company and hold them for the long run, using a buy limit order won't likely make a ton of difference. For example, if you have long-term conviction in Apple (AAPL 1.82%) and think it's trading at a fair price right now, there's little reason to use a buy limit order that could save you a few cents (or not get filled at all).\nHowever, there's a solid case to be made for buy limit orders if you only want to buy a stock if it reaches a certain price. Value investors commonly use this tactic, knowing that their orders will often go unfilled.\nRelated investing topics\n\n \n Stock Market Basics for Beginners\n \n \nIf you're just getting started investing, these basics can help guide you.\n\n \n Different Types of Stocks to Invest In: What Are They?\n \n \nStocks come in all different sizes and varieties. We break it down.\n\n \n How to Pick a Stock for the First Time\n \n \nBecoming a good stock-picker takes time and talent. We show you the way.\n\nExample of using a buy limit order\nExample of using a buy limit order\nAs of this writing, Microsoft (MSFT 1.82%) trades for $343.87 per share. Let's say I do some analysis and decide I'd like to own Microsoft, but only if I could buy it at $330 or less. So I set a buy limit order to purchase 10 shares at a maximum price of $330, good until I cancel it.\nThe order will not be fulfilled if the stock doesn't drop to $330 or less. I can decide to leave it open for as long as I want, cancel it, or replace it with a buy limit order with a higher minimum price. If it drops -- let's say the stock opens tomorrow at $326 -- the order will be fulfilled at the best possible price at the first moment it trades below the limit price.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n \n Matt Frankel, CFP, is a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst and personal finance expert covering financial stocks, REITs, SPACs, and personal finance.

The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.\n\nA chief operating officer, or COO, is a senior executive who oversees a company's day-to-day operations. The COO is typically the second in the chain of command below the chief executive officer, or CEO. The COO generally reports directly to the CEO.\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\nWhat is it?\nWhat is a COO?\nA COO is the most senior company executive in charge of overseeing its administrative and operational functions. The COO helps the CEO by taking over some of a company's administrative and operational burdens so the CEO can focus on leading its strategic direction. Similar titles can include a company's executive vice president of operations, chief operations officer, or operations director.\nA COO is a member of the C-suite. This group of senior company executives reports directly to the CEO and oversees various functions such as finance (chief financial officer, or CFO), information technology (chief information or technology officer, CIO or CTO), marketing (chief marketing officer, or CMO), and operations (chief operating officer, or COO).\nIn addition to having a single senior executive holding the COO role, some large companies will also hand the title out to the head of a specific business unit in charge of its operations. Their official title will denote that they're the COO for a geographic region or a particular business segment. Instead of running the entire company's day-to-day operations, they oversee a specific aspect of its operations.\n\nWhy are they important?\nWhy are COOs important to a company?\nA COO plays a crucial role in a company. Although the exact functions can vary by company or industry, they're vital to its success. The COO typically has a very close working relationship with the CEO. They often take over the day-to-day operational and administrative role to free up the CEO's time for more critical tasks.\nThe responsibilities of a COO can include:\nRunning the company's daily operations.\nInforming the CEO about significant events within the company.\nAdvising the CEO about important decisions.\nExecuting a company's business strategy.\nCommunicating a company's business strategy and goals to employees.\nOverseeing human resources.\nA company's CEO focuses on external issues by overseeing its overall strategy and direction; the COO focuses on internal issues. It's their job to ensure a company operates at its full potential. They're also responsible for making changes to improve a company's operations if they fail to meet expectations.\nWhat investors should know\nWhy investors should know a company's COO\nThe CEO is often the face of a company. Most investors know the name and some background information about the CEO leading one of the companies in which theyâ€™re invested. They also might know about the company's CFO since that person often speaks on the quarterly conference call and may provide a quote or two in an earnings press release.\nIn addition to knowing about those two top executives, investors should also learn the name and background of a company's COO, if it has one. Companies often hire COOs (either through an internal promotion or by bringing in a high-performing executive from another company) to take the business to the next level.\nCOOs often make great future CEOs. Many companies will promote a top internal performer to the COO role as a stepping stone to eventually becoming its CEO when the current one leaves. Other companies will hire a COO from another company to become their CEO if they don't have a strong internal candidate.\n\n \n What Is the Stock Market & How Does It Work?\n \n \nSo what is the stock market anyway?\n\n \n What Is a Hedge Fund?\n \n \nWhen wealthy investors put their money together to beat the market.\n\n \n Top Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025\n \n \nGet a list of the best companies to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nWho are some of the most important COOs?\nWho are some of the most important COOs?\nMany top executives have held the COO title in the past. For example, Tim Cook was COO of Apple (AAPL 1.82%) before he became the tech giant's CEO in 2011. Meanwhile, Sheryl Sandberg earned high regard for her COO role at Facebook -- now Meta Platforms (META 0.7%) -- in helping to drive its success.\nC-Suite Spotlight puts out an annual list of The Top 100 Chief Operating Officers. Topping its 2022 list was Ana Corrales, the COO of Google's -- Alphabet (GOOG 0.27%)(GOOGL 0.22%) -- consumer hardware and service business. She helps to lead the development process for the tech giant's hardware products, including Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit.\nAnother notable COO is Jane Brown, who ranks second on the 2022 list. She's the COO of UnitedHealth Group's (UNH -0.17%) UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of North Carolina and is responsible for producing results for its managed care business in that state.Top CEOs to Watch in 2025\n\nAbout the Author\n\n \n Matt DiLallo has been a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst specializing in covering dividend-paying companies, particularly in the energy and REIT sectors, since 2012.
