Chair Powell and earnings will again drive markets in the week ahead.\nPinterest stock is a buy with upbeat earnings on tap.\nPayPal shares are set to struggle amid weak results, sluggish outlook.\nStocks on Wall Street fell on Friday, after a blowout January jobs report revived fears that the Federal Reserve will continue hiking interest rates, while investors digested a mixed bag of megacap tech earnings.\nStill, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite managed to end the week on the positive side, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq notching its fifth straight winning week, the longest such streak since late 2021.\nThe S&P closed the week higher by 1.6%, the Nasdaq gained 3.3%, while the Dow was the outlier, falling 0.2%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nThe coming week is expected to be another busy one with most of the focus likely to fall once again on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to participate in a discussion at the Economic Club of Washington on Tuesday at 12:40PM ET.\nMeanwhile, the corporate earnings season continues, with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) all on the agenda. Some of the other notable reporters include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Kellogg (NYSE:K), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), BP (NYSE:BP), and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM).\nElsewhere, on the economic calendar, most important will be Friday’s U.S. consumer sentiment report for January as investors nervously await the next CPI inflation report due on Feb. 14.\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below we highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see further downside.\nRemember though, our timeframe is just for the upcoming week.\nStock To Buy: Pinterest \nAfter closing just below a 52-week high on Friday, I expect Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) shares to outperform in the coming week as the social media company’s latest financial results will surprise to the upside in my view, thanks to an improving fundamental outlook.\nPinterest is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings update after the U.S. market closes on Monday, Feb. 6. Based on the options market, traders are pricing in a large move for PINS stock following the report, with a possible implied swing of 13.1% in either direction.\nThe image-sharing social media company has topped Wall Street’s top line expectations for 12 straight quarters dating back to Q4 2019, while trailing profit estimates only twice in that span.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nConsensus estimates call for Q4 earnings of $0.27 per share, as per Investing.com, down 42.8% from EPS of $0.49 in the year-ago period. The company announced plans to lay off roughly 5% of its workforce last week as it attempts to rein in costs.\nMeanwhile, revenue is forecast to rise 4.8% year-over-year to $887 million. If that is in fact the reality, it would mark Pinterest’s highest quarterly sales total on record as it stands to benefit from increasing budget allocations from advertisers thanks to its unique position in the social media, search, and shopping ecosystems.\nDespite worries over an industry-wide slowdown in digital ad spending, Pinterest has seen companies flock to its platform as they seek to avoid the toxic and controversial content seen on other social media networks, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:META), Snap (NYSE:SNAP), TikTok, and Twitter.\nThat leads me to believe that the company will provide positive guidance for the current quarter given its improving fundamentals, stabilizing user growth trends, and increasing monetization potential under the leadership of chief executive Bill Ready. The former Google e-commerce executive, who replaced founding CEO Ben Silbermann last year, has already made progress on the social media company’s turnaround efforts.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nPINS stock broke out to a fresh 52-week high of $29.17 on Thursday, a level not seen since Feb. 2, 2022. It pulled back on Friday to end the week at $27.48, earning it a valuation of $18.6 billion.\nShares have roared back in the early part of 2023 following last year’s brutal selloff, gaining 13.2% year-to-date. Despite its recent turnaround, the stock remains roughly 70% away from its all-time peak of $89.90 reached in February 2021.\nStock To Sell: PayPal \nI believe shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) will underperform in the week ahead, as investors position themselves for a disappointing earnings report from the embattled digital payments provider.\nPayPal’s financial results for its fourth quarter are due on Thursday, Feb. 9, after the closing bell and are once again likely to take a hit from a slowdown in its core e-commerce business due to a combination of unfavorable consumer spending and customer demand trends as well as rising competition in the mobile payments processing industry.\nBased on moves in the options market, traders are pricing in a possible implied move of 9.3% in either direction in PayPal’s shares following the update.\nUnsurprisingly, analysts have slashed their EPS estimates by 16.5% in the 90 days leading up to the earnings report, according to an InvestingPro survey.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nConsensus calls for the digital payment processing company to post earnings of $1.20 per share, as per Investing.com, increasing 8.1% from EPS of $1.11 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is seen rising 6.8% from last year to $7.39 billion.\nPayPal said last month it planned to lay off 7% of its workforce, or roughly 2,000 employees, a move in line with the San Jose, California-based company’s previous commitment to rein in costs.\nDespite the year-over-year improvement on both the top-and-bottom line numbers, I think PayPal’s management will be prudent in its guidance for the year ahead due to the challenging operating environment and slowing e-commerce trends.\nIn addition, I believe that the growing popularity of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay and Block’s Cash App will negatively impact PayPal’s growth in the near term as it becomes increasingly vulnerable to losing market share in the online payments industry.\nThe company also faces fundamental uncertainty from recent news that several big banks, including JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), are working together to launch their own digital wallet that customers can use to shop online by the second half of 2023.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nPYPL stock, which fell to a bear-market low of $66.39 in late December, closed at $85.52 on Friday. At current valuations, the San Jose, California-based fintech giant has a market cap of $97.5 billion.\nShares, which have rallied to start the new year along with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, are up a whopping 20% through the first five weeks of 2023. Notwithstanding the recent turnaround, the stock remains about 72% away from its July 2021 all-time high of $310.16.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am short on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 via theProShares Short S&P 500 ETF (SH) and ProShares Short QQQ ETF (PSQ). I regularly rebalance my portfolio of individual stocks and ETFs based on ongoing risk assessment of both the macroeconomic environment and companies' financials.

AM\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Update: Corporate High-Yield Had a Good Week\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nBrian Gilmartin\nArticles(1413)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nIXIC\n0.44%\n\nUS10YT=X\n0.17%\n\nHYG\n-0.10%\n\nJNK\n-0.08%\n\nGOOG\n0.25%\n\nSHYG\n-0.05%\n\nPHDAX\n0.00%\n\nTwitter was the first medium – I believe it was Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg – that noted that the February 2nd, 2023, rally in the corporate high-yield asset class was the strongest day of spread narrowing since November ’20. This was confirmed by a long-time friend who has managed corporate bond money for 35 years – both insurance and total-return money – who confirmed that Thursday, February 2, 2023, was the 13th biggest “tightening” (i.e. spread tightening) day in the last 10 years.\nProbably due to the pandemic, this economic and S&P 500 earnings cycle is different.\nHere’s how clients' taxable high-yield performed this week:\nPHDAX: +91 bp’s on the week, to 4.76% from 3.85% last week;\nHYG ETF: +81 bp’s on the week to 4.25% from 3.44% last week;\nSHYG (short duration hi yld ETF): +64 bp’s on the week from 3.16% to 2.52% last week;\nThe returns represent YTD ’23 returns as of 2/4/23 and then 1/27/23.\nThe implication for the stock market is clear: spread tightening over longer periods of time is a positive underlying condition for both the US stock market and bond markets, as well as – generally speaking – the US economy since it says, the US credit markets are open and functioning.\nWhile the benchmark revisions muddied the January ’23 jobs report numbers, and we could likely see downward revisions in the months ahead, the fact is that the US economy remains in fairly good shape. Services PMI on Friday. released after the nonfarm payroll report, shot back up to 55. It was a month ago, the day of the December ’22 jobs report in early January when the Services PMI came in much worse-than-expected at 45, when “the Street” thought the services part of the US economy was finally capitulating to higher interest rates. Average the two months and Services is about 50, and neither expanding nor contracting.\nBut, the fly in the ointment is SP 500 earnings, and while I do think a component of the current weakness is the “normalization” of SP 500 earnings growth after 2020 and 2021 (post-pandemic) particularly within the tech sector, there is an “economic cyclicality” to the SP 500 earnings story.\nSP 500 Earnings data:\nThe forward 4-quarter (FFQE) earnings estimate for the SP 500 fell this past week to $223.28 from last week’s $225.02 which was a sequential decline of -0.77%, the sharpest sequential drop since the last time big tech reported earnings in late October, early November ’22.\nThe PE ratio as of Friday, February 3rd’s close was 18.5x versus last week’s 18x;\nThe SP 500 earnings yield fell to 5.40%, from last week’s 5.53% and Sept 30, ’22’s 6.53%;\nThe Q4 ’22 bottom-up SP 500 estimate rose last week to $53.44 from the prior week’s $53.26. That is a positive, although forward estimates continue to be under pressure;\nRate-of-change\n\nThis block starts early December ’22, and the 2023 EPS estimate is being watched. The 12-week downward revision was more severe this week, which we wanted to watch with last week’s earnings update, but the 2023 full-year rate-of-change is still not as severe as what we were seeing for 2023 in late 2022.\nHowever, I’d like to see those numbers improving, not getting worse.\nThe caveat to all this too is that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) forward EPS changes are NOT in the above data because they reported Thursday, February 2nd after the close and IBES data by Refinitiv cuts off the weekly data as of Thursday night’s market close, so next week’s data will reflect full estimate changes for the week ended February 3rd’s earnings releases.\nQuarterly, estimated, bottom-up, SP 500 EPS/revenue growth rates: \n\nThe above spreadsheet shows current, estimated, bottom-up SP 500 EPS and revenue growth rates for Q4 ’22, the four quarters of 2023, and then the first three quarters of 2024. Refinitiv basically gives subscribers an 8-quarter look at what’s expected for SP 500 earnings.\nQ4 ’22 showed upward revisions to Q4 ’22 EPS and revenue growth this past week;\n2023 by quarter shows weaker numbers until Q4 ’23 and then highs-single-digit EPS growth is expected for Q4 ’23 (as of this week);\n2024’s initial expectations show a stronger year brewing for SP 500 EPS and revenue estimates, but it’s still a little early;\nThe only reason this data is shown is that you have to look at SP 500 EPS and revenue data across different time frames.\nIf the SP 500 is a discounting mechanism that looks 12 – 15 months forward, then one should realistically assume that early 2024 is being factored into market prices and levels.\nGiven the inherent pessimism in the stock market, both on the part of corporate management and investors, there is typically a discount factor in SP 500 quarterly results that generates the “upside surprise” that the media talks about. Now the upside surprise or the beat rate has come down in late 2021 and early 2022, which was expected since Q1 and Q2 ’21 generated well-above-the-ordinary “upside surprise” or beat rates of 22% and 15% respectively in SP 500 EPS and 4% and 5.2% in SP 500 revenue, respectively.\nThe upside surprise in Q3 ’22 for the SP 500 EPS and revenue was 5.5% and 2.3% respectively.\nThis is all a return-to-normal for the expected SP 500 EPS and revenue growth rates post-pandemic, but it has taken 8 – 10 quarters to play out.\nSummary/conclusion:\nLooking at the results of JP Morgan’s corporate and investment bank or Goldman Sachs’ numbers in 2022, FICC (fixed-income, currency and commodities) and stock and bond underwriting were horrid, but the developments this past week and really in 2023 thus far (after 5 weeks) are showing an opening up of the bond markets for the first time in a year.\nIt feels like 1995 in terms of the still-pervasive negative market sentiment and skepticism, and the constant worry about a recession after what was back then the worst bond market ever in 1994. (The funny thing is in 1994, Barclay’s Aggregate fell just 2% for the full year, versus the 13% drop in the AGG in 2022.)\nThere is reason to worry over punk SP 500 earnings and guidance, but the fact that corporate spreads are improving, particularly high-yield, is an overlooked positive for sure.\nIf readers/investors/worriers see a day like Monday this past week, when the SP 500 fell 1.2% and the Nasdaq fell 2%, look at the daily change in the corporate high-yield ETFs like the HYG (of which clients are long) and the JNK. Compare the rates of change over time.\nAs someone who was studying money & banking in the fall of 1980 at a small school (the course was being taught by a local Federal Reserve manager), and Volcker was sending the fed funds rate to 20% and the 30-year Treasury hit 15% that fall, watching the 10-year Treasury yield trade down to 55 basis points in August 2020 just prior the Jackson Hole conference, felt like a life that had come full-circle. The point is that think how many US corporations refinanced debt (again) like from 2008 to 2016, at very low nominal rates and tighter credit spreads than the previous 30 years. It’s the same with the single-family mortgage market, too. The Fed data is showing that household balance sheets remain in good shape, probably from the wave of refinancings and lowering the cost of mortgage payments during 2020, 2021, and early 2022.\nTake all of this with substantial skepticism since it’s one person’s opinion. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The earnings data is courtesy of IBES data by Refinitiv, but the calculations and measurements are solely this blog’s so any mistakes are on me. Capital markets can change quickly, both positively and negatively, so assess your own level of risk and reward.\nThanks for reading.\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Update: Corporate High-Yield Had a Good Week\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,901.50\n+67.3\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,592.90\n+8.6\n+0.13%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.08\n+0.32\n+2.17%\n\nDollar Index \n97.012\n-0.134\n-0.14%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.82\n+0.13\n+0.21%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.08\n+0.09\n+0.13%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.958\n+0.017\n+0.58%\n\nGold Futures\n3,681.10\n-5.30\n-0.14%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.68\n-0.150\n-0.35%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.657\n+0.0050\n+0.11%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,041.13\n-4.88\n-0.47%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.063\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.678\n-0.001\n-0.02%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.31\n+0.03\n+0.03%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.75\n-0.13\n-0.10%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
