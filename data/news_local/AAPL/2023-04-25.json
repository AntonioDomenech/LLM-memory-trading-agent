Markets\n\nPublished04/25/2023, 09:40 AM\n\nIndexes Trade Sideways Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nAnna Coulling\nArticles(1367)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nESZ25\n0.16%\n\nRTYZ25\n0.34%\n\nYMZ25\n0.17%\n\nNQZ25\n0.08%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nLast week‚Äôs yawnfest continues on all the four indexes we follow, namely the Dow Jones Futures, S&P 500 Futures, Nasdaq 100 Futures & Russell 2000 Futures, with the indexes moving sideways in a narrow range. So far, generally benign earnings (aside from Tesla‚Äôs miss) and comments from FED members about interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical worries have all failed to shift the price action decisively either one way or another, so all we can say these markets do not want to fall yet.\nOur only certainty is the price action is building some very strong levels of both support and resistance, with the channel of price action developing into a really nice example of Wyckoff‚Äôs second law of cause and effect. This law states the longer this consolidation continues, the stronger the move once the price action breaks free.\nThe question is, what will it take to move these indexes, one way or another? Earnings so far reported have failed to do so, but the ones that matter begin today with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reporting after the bell. Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Google are due tomorrow and Thursday, respectively, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports next week.\nAn important aspect of these upcoming tech earnings is what effect recent layoffs have had on the bottom line ‚Äì it‚Äôs usually positive in the short term. Still, mass layoffs also point to a worry about future economic conditions. However, cutting too much could impact growth once the downturn ends.\nTo give you an indication of the scale of layoffs to date across the tech sector, Techcrunch is keeping a running total ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not good. It‚Äôs worth keeping an eye on this, particularly if you trade or invest in any of the companies mentioned. What‚Äôs interesting is Apple‚Äôs approach which simply refers to any lay-off as a ‚Äòre-org‚Äô, and the numbers involved are tiny compared to the other tech companies. We could argue Apple has so much money it can simply ride out any downturn.\nData coming out this week may also spark this moribund market into life. I do like the word ‚Äòmoribund‚Äô, which means ‚Äòlacking vitality‚Äô, as it describes perfectly the current price action and the market mood. The releases to watch are today‚Äôs CB Consumer Confidence, Thursday‚Äôs Advance GDP, and the Unemployment Claims, followed by the PCE on Friday.\nAnd you will have noticed we are currently in the usual FED blackout period ahead of next month‚Äôs FOMC. Other risk events to watch include the squabbling surrounding the debt ceiling, and whilst this is usually resolved this time around, the market appears worried there will be no agreement.\nWe know this because one-year US credit default swaps are trading at 106 basis points according to the FT, the highest since 2008 and up from 15 at the beginning. Credit default swaps are a form of insurance that pays out if a company or country reneges on its borrowings. Something to watch in the coming days and weeks. The issue may simply be deferred until autumn, but it‚Äôs an uncertainty the market could do without.\nMoving to the charts, below are the annotated daily and weekly for the YM, ES & NQ.\n\nLooking at today‚Äôs chart for the YM, the price action is confined to a very narrow range.\n\nThe ES also trading in a very narrow range as the index waits not only for the CB Consumer Confidence release but also the Microsoft and Google earnings which do not happen until after the bell, so trading is likely to be frustrating today. The index also holds onto reasonably strong support at 4140. Let‚Äôs see if the CB can help give it a bounce.\n\nFinally, the weekly chart NQ (E-Mini Future for the Nasdaq) ‚Äì NB ‚Äì Apologies annotation should say Google and Microsoft reporting today.\n\nIndexes Trade Sideways Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,901.50\n+67.3\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,592.90\n+8.6\n+0.13%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.09\n+0.33\n+2.24%\n\nDollar Index \n97.007\n-0.139\n-0.14%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.82\n+0.13\n+0.21%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.07\n+0.08\n+0.12%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.952\n+0.011\n+0.37%\n\nGold Futures\n3,679.60\n-6.80\n-0.18%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.663\n-0.167\n-0.39%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.655\n+0.0030\n+0.06%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,041.13\n-4.88\n-0.47%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.30\n+0.02\n+0.01%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.74\n-0.14\n-0.11%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what‚Äôs moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
