The vehicle is the second prototype from the company, following the Vision-S 01 electric car that was unveiled in 2020.\nTo show how serious the company might be about electric vehicles, Sony announced it had created a new business segment called Sony Mobility that will handle the vehicles under development.\n“We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony’s EV,” Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said.\nA new electric vehicle from Sony could come as technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is planning to launch an electric car by 2025 under the current name of Project Titan.\nUnlike Apple that has been relatively quiet on the details of its planned electric vehicles, Sony has now shown off two prototypes and last year shared that it was working with partners that included NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:"}, {"title": "Apple, Carnival, JPMorgan Stocks Provide Entry Point For Bullish Traders: How To Play It", "source": "Benzinga", "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/technicals/22/01/24914763/apple-carnival-jpmorgan-stocks-provide-entry-point-for-bullish-traders-how-to-play-it", "content": "Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL) and JP Morgan & Chase (NYSE: JPM) are all trading higher in strong uptrends. An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.\nThe higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with rising lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend and rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicating a long-term uptrend.\nA stock often signals when the higher high is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bearish engulfing or hanging man candlestick. Likewise, the higher low could be signaled when a doji, morning star or hammer candlestick is printed.

More than twice as many workers as expected found jobs last month, particularly in leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation, and utilities. Much of these gains may have occurred before the Omicron variant really hit the scene so we’ll have to wait and see if they stick.\nLater today, the FOMC Meeting Minutes will be released and investors will have insight into what the Fed has been discussing, particularly related to tapering and future interest rate hikes.\nThe Nasdaq-100 Futures (/NQ) are leading the slide on Wednesday once again. The Cboe Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXN)—also known as the Vixen—is the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) equivalent of the VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index), which is related to the S&P 500 (SPX). The Vixen rose 5.43% on Tuesday as investors sold tech stocks. While this may signal trouble for some tech companies, the fact that the VIX was relatively unchanged could be a good sign for the majority of stocks in the near term.  \nOne company that struggled to grow on Tuesday was Scott’s Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG). Scott’s fell 2.79% after providing guidance saying it would maintain its full-year earnings outlook, but its Hawthorne cannabis division expects a 40% decline in sales. The company cited the slowdown in the cannabis market and issues with the supply chain.\nThe ISM Manufacturing PMI was lower than expected, suggesting that manufacturers are seeing fewer orders. December was the 19th straight month of increases, but the slowdown may actually be a welcomed reprieve because it may provide relief to an already strained supply chain.\nThe JOLTS report also showed a decrease in job openings in November. The Great Resignation continues as the “quits” rate remained high. In the light of Wednesday’s ADP report, it may be that workers were simply quitting one job to take another job. Friday’s Employment Situation report could provide greater insights to these job market developments.\nMany stocks turned bearish after the manufacturing and job opening announcements; the S&P 500 (SPX) was positioned for a new all-time high, but it turned negative ..."}, {"title": "Wall Street is looking at Fed and the virus the wrong way, analyst says", "source": "MarketWatch", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-market-is-looking-at-the-fed-and-the-virus-the-wrong-way-this-wall-street-researcher-says-11641383612", "content": "George Saravelos, global co-head of currency research at Deutsche Bank, says the market is too focused on dots, which get to the question of how much the Fed lifts interest rates this year."}, {"title": "The U.S. Stock Market Just Did Something It May Never Do Again", "source": "The Motley Fool", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/05/the-us-stock-market-just-did-something-it-may-neve/", "content": "Big gains from Apple, Microsoft, and others helped catapult the S&P 500 to new heights."}, {"title": "Apple Is Still Innovating and Yields More Than You Think", "source": "The Motley Fool", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/05/apple-is-still-innovating-and-yields-more-than-you/", "content": "Apple's relatively small dividend yield does not tell the whole story of why this stock has potential for growth and dividend investors."}]}
