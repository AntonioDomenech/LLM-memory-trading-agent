Over the past 12 months, this sector has brought forth programming that has invigorated home audiences (think of “Squid Game,” “Bridgerton” and “The Beatles: Get Back,” among countless others) and dominated the news headlines with controversies (Tucker Carlson's three-part Fox Nation series on the Jan. 6 siege, the brouhaha over Dave Chappelle’s “The Closer” special or the Scarlett Johansson lawsuit from last summer over the simultaneous theatrical and streaming releases of “Black Widow” by the Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS).)\nThe streaming services, which were promoted during the height of the pandemic as an alternative entertainment source when movie theaters were closed, are now the dominant force in the most prestigious center of the film world – in this year’s Academy Award nominations, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) emerged as the powerhouse studios, gaining multiple nominations for such films as “The Power of the Dog,” “CODA,” “Don’t Look Up” and “Being the Ricardos.”\nIn a sense, the streaming sector has grown up. But while the sector is flexing its muscles to display its newfound strength, it is also discovering new muscles that have yet to be developed – which, in the near-future, could further solidify its audience base while generating new revenue streams.\nWider Horizons: Tim Nollen, senior media analyst at Macquarie Bank, predicted this transition would occur last December in his paper “Advertising and Media: Macro and Micro Themes for 2022,” with a forecast that the major media operations would prioritize streaming over other media platforms.\n“A key common theme among the media networks is the launch and ramp up of their DTC streaming services, as these companies look to make the transition from pay TV to OTT business models,” Nollen wrote. “2021 was a particularly exciting time for this, especially with the launch of Discovery+ and the rebrand of Paramount+. But as 2021 new services come to market and existing services start to expand internationally, we believe that 2022 will be a year with heightened levels of competition as the streaming wars move to new levels.”\nFor the media companies, Nollen observed, there are no limits – either financial or geographic – in the pursuit of success.\n“All of the media networks are talking about 2022 being an important investment year where elevated levels of content production are designed to attract and keep consumers to their service amid this increasingly more competitive environment,” he continued. “2022 will also be the year of international expansion as the newer services start to ramp up their international expansion and existing players engage in aggressive marketing to maintain and expand their market share.”\nSeth Shafer, senior analyst at Kagan, the media research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, observed that the major streaming services are working aggressively to forge ahead of their rivals.\n“We're still in a growing market – it's obviously a crowded market,” he said. “I think in 2022 we’re going to see more – and I hate to use warfare analogies, especially these days – intense competition between the major U.S. services to keep subscribers engaged and to minimize churn.”\nSee Also: Did Disney Cancel The In-Production Film Of 'Nimona' Because Of A Same-Sex Kiss?\nCosts And Benefits: Shafer pointed out that today’s average consumer may subscribe to three-to-five streaming services, keeping “a couple as anchors and then moving in and out of their services as they catch up on content.” However, he cautioned that the recent dramatic changes in the economy might force many viewers ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"}, {"title": "Just One More Reason to Be Bullish on Apple Stock", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/03/20/just-one-more-reason-to-be-bullish-on-apple-stock/", "content": "Apple's latest development gives it even greater competitive advantage."}, {"title": "Meta Platforms Stock: Bear vs. Bull", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/03/20/meta-platforms-facebook-bull-vs-bear/", "content": "Lately, the bears have had a louder voice on the social media giant, but the bulls may come rushing in."}, {"title": "Apple Stock: Bear vs. Bull", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/03/20/apple-stock-bear-vs-bull/", "content": "Can the tech titan keep generating impressive returns?"}, {"title": "3 Tech Stocks That Can Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million in 8 Years (or Less)", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/03/20/3-tech-stocks-turn-200000-to-1-million-in-8-years/", "content": "These high-growth tech stocks can make patient investors a lot richer."}, {"title": "Trading The Top 10 Stocks From 40 Large Hedge Funds: Trading Update 3/19/2022", "source": {"name": "Seeking Alpha", "homepage_url": "https://seekingalpha.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/seekingalpha.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/seekingalpha.ico"}, "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4496626-trading-the-top-10-stocks-from-40-large-hedge-funds", "content": "This portfolio strategy uses the quarterly 13F filings to extract 50 consensus stocks from 40 large hedge funds that have more than $3.5 billion Assets Under Management."}]}
