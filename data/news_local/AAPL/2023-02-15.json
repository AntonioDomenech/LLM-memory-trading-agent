Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nNDX\n0.42%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nQYLD\n0.12%\n\nThere is another.\n‚ÄìYoda\nThe Jedi Master had last week‚Äôs 8.4% dividend in mind, no doubt. David Friar‚Äôs Nuveen Nasdaq 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX)is an elite 8%+ payer worthy of a discussion.\nBut yes, Yoda, there is another. A rival ETF, also based on ‚Äúthe Qs‚Äù‚Äîthe Nasdaq 100. The Force must be strong with this one‚Äîit yields 12.7%.\nIs this for real? Or a Hollywood fairy tale?\nWell, let‚Äôs go back to David, QQQX‚Äôs manager. His elite 8%+ yield is no joke either. He‚Äôs doing something that many of us have dabbled with. He buys tech stocks and sells (‚Äúwrites‚Äù) covered calls on his positions.\nIt‚Äôs a tedious strategy. As sellers of options, we want them to decline in price. Which happens fastest as we approach their expiration dates.\nProblem is, selling covered calls for income tends to be a monthly effort. That can be a pain with a single stock‚Äîand it becomes progressively more annoying as we diversify the portfolio. So, we outsource the task to someone like David and collect our 8.4% per year as we tip our caps to him.\nWhy does he focus on tech stocks? They are volatile and command higher option premiums. As a seller of these premiums, David signs up for nausea.\nBut volatility is a knife that cuts both ways and, conservative strategy or not, covered calls won‚Äôt prevent price declines. I mean, the Nasdaq-100 lost 33% last year.\nQQQX wasn‚Äôt much better. It ‚Äúoutperformed‚Äù its index, losing ‚Äúonly‚Äù 27%.\nNot exactly what we look for in retirement investment.\nReaders often ask me if a dividend is safe. But payouts are really only half the battle, because price matters. QQQX actually raised its dividend in 2022 (yay, higher volatility) but still dropped 27%. Including those payouts.\nNo thanks. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt currently hold QQQX in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio (since selling it near a previous tech top). Better to stuff cash under a mattress and wait for the Qs to bottom out before we start jousting with QQQX again.\nWhen the Qs finally wash out, rival fund Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD) will be worth our consideration too. Its headline 12.7% yield can be a Jedi mind trick. It depends on our timing.\nWith QYLD‚Äôs monthly payout, we contrarians are up to the challenge. I mean, what‚Äôs not to like about 1% in cash coming our way every 30 days?\nNow QYLD, unlike QQQX with Dave, is automatic. QYLD sells (‚Äúwrites‚Äù) one big NASDAQ call option. It doesn‚Äôt pick and choose.\nIt‚Äôs easier than selling individual calls, but it doesn‚Äôt pay as much. The option premium is lower on the index than it is on the individual stock positions (even when we add them up).\nThat said, sometimes we don‚Äôt care. QYLD‚Äôs ‚Äúdays to expiry‚Äù on that option is just eight days as I write. Which is good. It‚Äôs going down fast in value, which is good for QYLD shareholders who own a short position on the call.\n\nHowever, the underlying value of the index‚Äîand funds like QQQX and QYLD‚Äîis determined by the long-term trend in interest rates.\nRates? Not profits?\nYou Must Unlearn What You Have Learned\nYeah, rates. We roughly know how much money Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (the NASDAQ‚Äôs top two stocks) will make over the next five years. But, due to inflation, we don‚Äôt know how much those profits are worth today.\nThe 10-year Treasury began 2022 with a yield of just 1.5%. With a basement ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù rate like this, future profits are nearly as good as cash-in-hand right now.\nThen inflation struck, and long rates soared. The 10-year ended 2022 at 3.9%, a 155% increase! The trend acted as a death star on valuations.\nAs the 10-year climbed, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of MSFT contracted by 26% and AAPL by 25%. This was no coincidence. Higher rates hurt valuations. Which, in turn, hurt the net asset values (NAVs) of Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), QQQX, and QYLD (not pictured). Which crushed these funds‚Äô prices.\nRates Up, QQQ and QQQX Down\nCovered calls, again, can only do so much damage control! Until we think the Qs have bottomed, we need to be careful of all Nasdaq-related funds. Even those paying 8.4% and 12.7%!\nAnd tech stocks won‚Äôt bottom until rates top. I‚Äôm not sure they have just yet.\nBe ready. We‚Äôll get an opportunity to buy one, or both, of these funds at a better value later this year. When rates top, P/Es crater and nobody wants to own these things other than calculated income investors like us.\nSmaller in number are we contrarians, but larger in mind.\nAnd fear not, because we do have monthly dividends with lower risk. They pay 7%+ per year and these rock-steady dividends are in the bargain bin.\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.
