Known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRKA)(NYSE: BRKB), a conglomerate that is one of the largest companies in the world.\nHere’s a look at how Buffett got started with Berkshire Hathaway and how much investing alongside him could have been worth.\nWhat Happened: Buffett is one of the greatest investors of the current generation and is known for a buy-and-hold approach for investing. He also uses that approach in his life, living in the same house for the past 65 years.\nBefore his buy-and-hold approach used today, Buffett was interested in buying low-priced stocks in the 1960s, including companies that were well-run but trading at low prices.\n“If (the stocks) were cheap enough, he didn’t care it was a lousy company and lousy management. He knew he was going to make money anyways because of the cheapness,” Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said in the “Becoming Warren Buffett Documentary,” CNBC reported.\nBuffett bought his first shares of textile company Berkshire Hathaway in December 1962 for $7.50 each.\n“I bought the first shares of Berkshire in 1962 and it was a northern textile business destined to become extinct eventually,” Buffett said. “It was a statistically ..."}, {"title": "Apple Rises After Jerome Powell Wraps Up Testimony: Will The iStock Negate Technical Pattern?", "source": {"name": "Benzinga", "homepage_url": "https://www.benzinga.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"}, "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/03/31280280/apple-rises-after-jerome-powell-wraps-up-testimony-will-the-istock-negate-technical-patt", "content": "Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) was edging higher on Thursday in tandem with the S&P 500. The move comes following two days of testimony by Jerome Powell, where the Federal Reserve chair took a hawkish stance in front of House and Senate committees, warning that stubbornly high inflation could impact how high and how many more times the central bank will need to hike interest rates.\nPowell said the Fed will need to take “into account the totality of incoming data\" to make its decisions. Positive news for the stock market came on Thursday morning when the Labor Department released data showing initial jobless claims increased by 21,000 to 211,000 last week.\nThe news caused Apple to break up bullishly from an inside bar pattern. An inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the trend.\nAn inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour chart or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick ..."}, {"title": "AI Revolution on the Horizon: 2 High-Potential Growth Stocks to Watch in 2023", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/09/ai-revolution-on-the-horizon-2-high-potential-grow/", "content": "They've been using machine learning for years, and now they might do even more."}, {"title": "This fund has increased its dividend for 56 straight years.
