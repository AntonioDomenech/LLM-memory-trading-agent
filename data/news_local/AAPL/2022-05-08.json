dividend stocks are the best bargain on the board right now. I love them because lame income investors don‚Äôt consider them. They fixate on:\nLarge-cap stocks: For dividend safety.\nSmall-cap stocks: For dividend growth.\nMeanwhile many great under-the-radar mid-cap stocks sit between $2 billion and $10 billion in market capitalization. They sit in a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù that accommodates dividend safety and growth.\nWhich is why they generate big returns.\nTouchstone Investments reports that, when looking at 20-year rolling returns, mid-caps have experienced ‚Äútypically higher absolute returns during the last 42 years‚Äù:\nSource: Touchstone Investments\nIt‚Äôs easy to overlook these names‚Äîthe media doesn‚Äôt talk about them as much, and they tend to have far less analyst coverage than the Apples (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsofts (MSFT) of the world. But that information void is exactly how we can reap deep discounts in this mid-sized space.\nLet‚Äôs talk about five mid-caps that are trading on the cheap. I‚Äôm talking about single-digit price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios with generous yields between 7.2% and 15.3% as I write (and no, that‚Äôs not a typo).\n1. New York Community Bancorp - Dividend Yield:7.2% - Forward P/E: 6.7\nNew York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) (NASDAQ:CTBI)is the holding company for New York Community Bank, a savings bank with 237 branch offices serving five states‚Äîand rather than being regionally locked, it serves the northeast (N.Y./New Jersey), Midwest (Ohio), Southeast (Florida) and Southwest (Arizona).\nUnlike many financial stocks with outsized yields, NYCB is just a regular, run-of-the-mill bank. It has nearly $60 billion in assets across a wide array of traditional offerings, such as checking and savings accounts, mortgages, business accounts, commercial lending and more.\nHowever, NYCB is trading for cheap‚Äîand delivering an even fatter yield than normal‚Äîbecause of a roughly 30% decline from its 2022 highs that‚Äôs well worse than its contemporaries.\nWhy Is New York Community Bancorp Getting Crushed?\nPart of it is just NYCB being carried along for the financial-sector ride lower. Part of it was recently reported quarterly results that were merely in line with estimates.\nBut also weighing on shares is an extension of a merger with Michigan-headquartered Flagstar Bancorp (NYSE:FBC), which would see the deal likely close in the second half of 2022, and the announcement that the new combined company would need the blessing of both the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency‚Äîand the latter isn‚Äôt a slam-dunk.\nAnd even if it does, Flagstar, which depends heavily on its mortgage business, has its own struggles, as evidenced by a wide quarterly miss.\nThe sweet dividend looks safe, M&A or not. But whether NYCB can actually turn its value into additional upside is something of a gamble that hinges on both successfully merging with Flagstar, and Flagstar carrying its weight.\n2. Old Republic International - Dividend Yield: 4.1%/10.7% - Forward P/E: 8.9\nAnother high-yielding financial worth a look is Old Republic International Corp (NYSE:ORI)‚Äîa general- and title-insurance provider whose decent headline yield belies a far larger chunk of change being tossed to investors.\nOld Republic is part of an elite group of stocks that most investors tend to overlook: The Dividend Aristocrats. ‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of them.‚Äù Yes, you‚Äôve heard of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats‚Äîthe club where the likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) hang out.\nBut there‚Äôs a large number of longstanding mid-cap dividend growers, and they‚Äôre recognized by inclusion in the lesser-known S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats.\nORI is a particularly noteworthy mid-cap Aristocrat, at four decades of uninterrupted payout hikes.\nBut what really makes Old Republic International is that it keeps reliably raising its payout and has a pretty good regular yield while also overseeing one of the more responsible dividend programs you‚Äôll find‚Äîa program that, when times are good, can shift that payout into high gear.\nORI has a two-part dividend system where it pays out regular quarterly dividends, but also special annual payouts based on its profits for the year. For instance, a $1.50-per-share special dividend delivered last fall brings ORI‚Äôs yield into double digits. (Just remember: These special dividends can vary from year to year.)\n3. Crestwood Equity Partners LP - Dividend Yield: 8.6% - Forward P/E: 12.4\nCrestwood Equity Partners LP (NYSE:CEQP) is a midstream master limited partnership (MLP) that owns a number of assets involved in the gathering, processing, treating, compression and/or storage of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and even produced water.\nIts assets are primarily located in the Williston, Delaware and Powder River basins, as well as the Marcellus and Barnett shales.\nMost investors would be happy for an overall return like CEQP‚Äôs, which is up 8% in a down market. Flip side? That‚Äôs nowhere near what other MLPs and the energy sector as a whole are doing.\nCEQP Pretty Weak By Comparison\nHolding CEQP back was a generally lousy first quarter in which both EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and DCF (distributable cash flow, which is what MLP distributions are paid out of) were both lower than Wall Street expected.\nThat said, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and expects Williston, Powder River and Delaware to become more productive later in 2022. The company is also returning to distribution growth, which means this fat yield, if bought now, will get even fatter on your cost basis.\n4. Gerdau - Dividend Yield: 9.4% - Forward P/E: 4.5\nS√£o Paulo, Brazil-based steelmaker Gerdau (NYSE:GGB)boasts mills in its home country, as well as Argentina, Canada, Mexico and a few other Latin American countries. It‚Äôs also the United States‚Äô largest producer of long steel. (Long steel covers a number of products, such as rods, rails and wires, as well as girders and structural sections.)\nGerdau is like most material stocks in that they‚Äôre playing in a wildly cyclical field. While both its top and bottom lines have been going in the right direction for a while, you‚Äôre not going to get the same operational straight-line performance you‚Äôd expect from, say, a company selling soap.\n2018 revenues, for instance, came in at 46.2 billion Brazilian reals, declined to 39.6 billion in 2019, rebounded to 43.8 billion in 2020 and escalated to a massive 78.3 billion in 2021.\nFortunately, that‚Äôs not an anomaly‚Äîsales are expected to remain at varying levels above 70 billion reals over the next two years. Really, Gerdau is just chugging along.\nInvestors Have No Beef With Brazil‚Äôs GGB\nGGB is similar to the likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)in that it seems perpetually cheap, but a quick drop in April has really put the stock into deep-value territory.\nWe should note, though, that Gerdau is a ‚Äúyoung man‚Äôs dividend stock.‚Äù That is, it can produce a lot of income, but it doesn‚Äôt do it consistently. Gerdau will pay out at least 30% of the year‚Äôs adjusted net income in dividends, but payouts are all over the map.\nIts last four dividends were 3.95 cents, 29 cents, 7 cents and 10.5 cents. That‚Äôs difficult to plan your retirement around‚Äîbut easier to deal with if you‚Äôre letting compounding do its thing over a few decades or so.\n5. OneMain - Dividend Yield: 7.7%/12.2% - Forward P/E: 5.3\nOneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF) provides personal installment loans to millions of Americans, many of whom have non-prime credit scores.\nIt can be a turbulent business, but it did grow like a weed during COVID. And while it‚Äôs cooling off, it hasn‚Äôt chilled. Delinquencies, for instance, have been ticking up over the past few months, but that‚Äôs mostly seasonal‚Äîthey‚Äôre actually slightly lower year-over-year. OMF shares are performing admirably compared to the sector as a result.\n\nThis is a hardy business‚Äîone that expects itself to be profitable even if the U.S. slips into recession. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs improving upon shareholder rewards in not one but two ways:\nHigher buybacks: In late 2021, the company upped its buyback authorization from $200 million to $300 million.\nBigger dividends: In February 2022, the company announced a whopping 35% hike in its quarterly payout, to 95 cents per share. It was 25 cents just three years ago.\nNow, based on that quarterly dividend, OMF yields right around 7.7%. But OneMain is another routine special-dividend payer, and that sum has improved for years as well.

Markets\n\nPublished05/08/2022, 12:49 AM\n\nBond Market Woes, And Forward S&P 500 Earnings Weakened A Little\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nBrian Gilmartin\nArticles(1412)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nCSCO\n-1.71%\n\nAGG\n-0.09%\n\nSPY\n-0.03%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nWMT\n0.82%\n\nCL\n0.16%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nUS10YT=X\n0.44%\n\nXLY\n0.52%\n\nAs of 5/6/22:\nSPY YTD return: -13.13%\nBarclays Aggregate (AGG) YTD return: -10.42%\nStandard 60%/40% benchmark portfolio return: -12.05%\nDespite the headlines this week, the S&P 500¬†fell -0.21% the last 5 trading days, for its lowest weekly loss of the last 5. Here‚Äôs the chronology with the ending 10-year Treasury yield each week:\n5/6/22:S&P 500 weekly loss of -0.21%, 10-year Treasury yield closes at 3.13%;\n4/29/22: S&P 500 weekly loss of -3.27%, 10-year Treasury yields closes at 2.88%;\n4/22/22: S&P 500 weekly loss of -2.64%, 10-tear Treasury yields closes at 2.90%;\n4/15/22: S&P 500 weekly loss of -2.39%, 10-year Treasury yield closes at 2.83%;\n4/8/22: S&P 500 weekly loss at -0.67%, 10-year Treasury yield closes at 2.71%;\nThe 5-week loss for the S&P 500 is about 9%, while the increase in the 10-year Treasury yield for that some period is about 42 basis points. Are the two related? Is correlation causality? While there are a lot of reasons being tossed about today about the stock market weakness, that 42 bp increase has to be close to the top of the list. Just in the last 5 weeks that is a 15% ‚Äúrelative‚Äù increase in the 10-year Treasury yield. High grade corporate bond duration near the end of 2021 got above 9 years (watching the Bloomberg data), and while it‚Äôs a little lower now, that still implies a 9% drop in the value of the ETF or fund for a 100 bp parallel move in interest rates.\nAccording to one of the Refinitiv reports emailed to me every week, Friday‚Äôs April ‚Äô22 jobs report was the 12th straight month of +400,000 net, new, jobs created. That‚Äôs pretty impressive. The report went on to say ‚Äúleisure and hospitality‚Äù was the strongest sector creating +78,000 jobs. So, are the original pandemic-driven job losses like restaurants finally re-hiring those workers?\nThe next FOMC meeting statement is June 16th, 2022. Jay Powell has already said 50 bps is planned. Not much mystery left, but we do have April inflation data, and the the May jobs report and possibly May inflation data, before the next June meeting. Crude oil is not really weakening, but it isn‚Äôt making new highs either. The high end of the current Fed funds target is now 1% and Jay Powell has said that ‚Äúneutral‚Äù is at least 2%. The late ‚Äô18 decade high for the 10-year Treasury yield was 3.23% ‚Äì 3.24%. That was the very end of Jay Powell‚Äôs last monetary policy tightening round.\nIn late 2010, early 2011, the 10-year Treasury yield managed to get up around 3.50% ‚Äì 3.75%. The rest of the decade was well below that range.\nS&P 500 earnings data: \nThe forward 4-quarter estimate this week slid to $234.44 from $234.97 last week, the first sequential decline since the week of March 25th, 2022;\nThe PE ratio on the forward estimate is 17.5x, down from 22x on 12/31/21;\nThe S&P 500 earnings yield this week is 5.69%, the exact same print as last week‚Äôs 5.69%;\nThe Q1 ‚Äô22 bottom-up estimate rose to $54.41 versus $53.03 last week and $51.99 two weeks ago;\nHow have full-year 2022 expected sector growth rates changed since 12/31?\n\nIn last week‚Äôs earnings update¬†it was noted that with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reporting their March quarter results on Thursday night, the earnings revisions might not get fully incorporated into the consensus estimates until this week, and that appears to be the case with Amazon and Consumer Discretionary.\nNote the decline in Consumer Discretionary‚Äôs full-year 2022 EPS growth rate in the last two weeks. Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are the two biggest sector weights in ‚ÄúCD‚Äù. Consumer Discretionary‚Äôs weight in the S&P 500 (market-cap weight) is slightly over 11%.\nApple‚Äôs quarter didn't seem to have the negative effect on tech‚Äôs full-year 2022 EPS growth rate that was initially thought.\nSummary / conclusion: The difficult market is eventually going to results in sell-side analysts pulling in their horns on expected EPS growth within the S&P 500, although the healthy job growth and economic data is probably mitigating that tendency right now. It will happen eventually though.\nThe $64,000 question today is how far away is a recession? JP Morgan this week noted that the chance of a recession in 2022 is probably 15%, while that probability grows in 2023 to closer to 30%. I thought Goldman put out a note that recession odds are 33% as we exit 2022.\nHousing is no bubble; it‚Äôs all about supply. Brian Wesbury over at First Trust has been writing about that topic almost since the 2008 Crisis ended.\nAfter trying to buy a house the last 2 -3 months, I‚Äôve stepped away after being outbid on every home. Those who bought homes at the top in 2008 took years to break even. I don‚Äôt have that much runway left. Maybe higher rates will restore some rationality to buyers. (Housing and homebuilders are part of the consumer discretionary sector, too. As is the auto sector.)\nNo companies reporting this week hold any interest. The next big reports will be Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\nTake everything you read here with substantial skepticism. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and none of this is a recommendation to buy or sell. The capital markets change quickly, both positively and negatively. If commodities crack and correct substantially, including energy, although this post¬†makes that seem less possible, I think it could give Jay Powell some breathing room.\n\nBond Market Woes, And Forward S&P 500 Earnings Weakened A Little\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,908.00\n+73.8\n+0.16%\n\nUS 500 \n6,595.90\n+11.6\n+0.18%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.08\n+0.32\n+2.17%\n\nDollar Index \n97.125\n-0.021\n-0.02%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.79\n+0.10\n+0.16%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.33\n+0.34\n+0.51%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.972\n+0.031\n+1.05%\n\nGold Futures\n3,677.50\n-8.90\n-0.24%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.71\n-0.120\n-0.28%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6638\n+0.0118\n+0.25%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,045.50\n-0.75\n-0.07%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.077\n+0.018\n+0.44%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.696\n+0.017\n+0.36%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.633\n+0.008\n+0.22%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.22\n-0.06\n-0.06%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.68\n-0.20\n-0.16%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
