At extremes, sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, extreme positive sentiment is a sell signal. However, it is important to remember that sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.\nIn The Arora report analysis, based on the other macro and fundamental data, there is about a 40% probability that the breakout will fail even though technicals are very strong.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) came slightly cooler than expected. Here are the details:\n\nHeadline CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.\nCore CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.\n\n\nAs most investors are elated over the CPI number, prudent investors need to remember that on an annualized basis, core CPI is still 3.6%. The Fed’s target is 2%. Further, prudent investors need to remember that goods inflation is coming down due to over production in China, but services inflation is still sticky.   \nThe U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Here is the latest retail sales data.\n\nHeadline retail sales came at 0.0% vs. 0.4% consensus.\nRetail sales ex-auto came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.\n\n\nRetail sales data shows that the consumer is finally pulling back. This will negatively impact earnings. In the long run, the single best determinant of the stock market is earnings. However, at least for today, elated investors are not thinking far ahead about earnings.\nIt is said that copper has a Ph.D. in economics. That is why it is called Dr. Copper.  When the economy is booming, demand for copper goes up. In recessions, demand for copper drops. Copper futures in New York just hit a new high. Copper is also heavily used in electric vehicles and solar panels. Heavy demand for electricity by artificial intelligence data centers will also increase copper demand.\nIn The Arora Report analysis, the new high in copper is ...Full story available on Benzinga.com"}, {"title": "3 Streaming Stocks Capitalizing on Rising Demand for Bundling", "source": {"name": "Zacks Investment Research", "homepage_url": "https://www.zacks.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"}, "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2274050/3-streaming-stocks-capitalizing-on-rising-demand-for-bundling", "content": "Here we present three streaming stocks positioned to capitalize on the trend of competing media companies forming partnerships to bundle their services, aimed at driving subscriber acquisition and retention."}, {"title": "U.S. Chip Manufacturing Could Triple in Less Than a Decade: 2 Stocks That Could Follow Suit", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/15/us-chip-manufacturing-could-triple-in-less-than-a/", "content": "The secular growth of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. could benefit these two chip stocks in the long run."}, {"title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/15/warren-buffett-stocks-screaming-buys-now/", "content": "Warren Buffett and his team are betting huge sums of money on these two companies."}, {"title": "2 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/15/3-top-buffett-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-long/", "content": "Despite recent stock price troubles, these companies have long-term value propositions that investors should consider."}]}
