Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.\n\nApple (AAPL 1.82%) is one of the largest companies in the world. It has come a long way from humble beginnings. College dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded the company in 1976 with a vision of shrinking the size of computers so everyone could have them in their homes and businesses.\n\nInnovation\nApple's investments, products, and VR launch\nToday, many of us hold an Apple-branded computer product in the palm of our hand. The company has developed many widely successful products, like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\nApple continues to invest heavily in product innovation to upgrade its offerings and stay ahead of the competition. In 2024, it launched a new virtual reality (VR) headset, the Apple Vision Pro. The new product could help drive more growth for the consumer technology product giant.\n\nIn addition to technology products, Apple has a growing services business (e.g., iCloud, AppleTV+, and Apple Music). The company's streaming platforms, cloud solutions, and other services generate recurring revenue, helping offset some of the variability of product sales. The company is also an early leader in artificial intelligence (AI), launching Apple Intelligence in 2024.\n\n Cloud Computing\n \nCloud computing is a network of interconnected servers and data centers working together to deliver a service through the Internet.\n\nThe company's service offerings are growing faster than product revenue. And they deliver higher-margin revenue for Apple, making them an important profit growth driver.\nThe Apple ecosystem of products and services has created unparalleled customer loyalty. Apple fans often purchase the latest version of its iPhone as soon as it's available. They stay subscribed to its growing number of services, helping steadily increase revenue, earnings, and cash flow. The growth should enable Apple stock to continue its upward climb.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on buying shares of Apple and some factors to consider before investing in the technology stock.\nHow to buy\nHow to buy Apple stock\nYou can buy shares of Apple in any brokerage account. If you still need to open one, these are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms. And if you've never placed a trade before, check out our guide to six steps for buying stocks.\nHere's an example of how to buy Apple stock using the five-star-rated Fidelity platform, which makes it easy to buy stocks. Its website offers a video tutorial and a step-by-step guide. The screenshot below shows what it looks like to place a stock trade with Fidelity:\nImage source: Fidelity.\n\nOn this page, you would fill out all the relevant information, including:\nThe number of shares you want to buy or the amount you want to invest to purchase fractional shares.\nThe ticker symbol (AAPL for Apple).\nWhether you want to place a limit order or a market order. The Motley Fool recommends using a market order since it guarantees you buy shares immediately at the market price at that moment.\nOnce you complete the order page, click the \"Place Order\" button at the bottom and become an Apple shareholder.\n\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in Apple?\nBefore investing in Apple, you need to determine whether the company's stock is a good fit for your portfolio. Here are some reasons why you might want to consider buying Apple stock:\nYou love Apple's products and want to invest in the company that makes them.\nYou believe Apple's shares can continue to outperform the S&P 500.\nYou understand how Apple makes money.\nYou think Apple can continue developing innovative products that increase its revenue, income, and free cash flow at a healthy rate.\nYou believe Apple can continue growing its higher-margin services offerings at a strong pace.\nYou want to invest in a financially strong company.\nYou want to earn some dividend income and believe Apple can continue growing its payout.\nYou think Apple does a great job allocating its copious cash flows to increase shareholder value, including its preference for share repurchases.\nYou believe Apple's strategic investments in digital content, payment processing, cloud services, and advertising will accelerate growth.\nYou have faith that CEO Tim Cook can continue growing shareholder value.\nYou understand the risks of investing in Apple stock, including that it could lose value.\nYou think the 2024 release of Apple's new Apple Vision Pro will be a catalyst to drive the company's profits and stock price higher.\nImage source: Apple.\n\nOn the other hand, here are some factors to think about that might lead you to decide against buying Apple stock:\nYou're not a fan of Apple's products.\nYou're not sure Apple can outperform the market.\nYou think Apple's days of product innovation are in the rearview mirror.\nYou need a higher dividend yield than Apple currently offers.\nYou are a younger investor and want to invest in a company earlier in its growth cycle than Apple.\nYou're worried about the economy and think a recession could affect demand for Apple products.\nYou're concerned that a competitor could start eating into Apple's dominant share of the smartphone market.\nYou don't think Apple's VR headset will move the needle for the company's earnings or stock price.\nProfitability\nIs Apple profitable?\nIncome growth helps fuel stock price appreciation over the longer term. It's an ideal area for beginning investors to focus on before buying shares of any company.\n\nApple is an extremely profitable company. It recorded $296 billion in revenue and $79 billion in net income during the first nine months of its 2024 fiscal year. While revenue was only up about $3 billion compared to the prior-year period, earnings per share grew by more than 9%.\nThe company posted record revenue in its fiscal third quarter of 2024. The tech titan noted that the installed base of its active devices reached an all-time high in the period ending June 2024. Apple's steadily rising profits have helped drive its stock price skyward over the years:\nImage source: YCharts.\n\nApple generates most of its revenue from selling products (76% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024). However, services are an important profit-growth driver. Services revenue is growing faster than product revenue (13% versus an almost 3% decline in the first nine months of fiscal 2024).\nApple's income should continue to rise. The technology giant invests heavily in developing innovative products (like the Apple Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence) that could become major growth drivers. It also continues expanding its service offerings, providing the company with more recurring revenue.\n\nApple does an excellent job of converting revenue into cash flow. The technology giant generated $91.4 billion in cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, giving it the funds to invest in growing its business and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases -- all while maintaining one of the world's strongest financial profiles.\n\nDividends\nDoes Apple pay a dividend?\nApple has paid a dividend on its stock since reinstating the dividend payout in 2012. The company started paying dividends in 1987 but suspended the payout in 1995.\nSince reinstating the shareholder payout more than a decade ago, Apple has increased its dividend every year. Apple paid $11.4 billion in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 -- it was one of the top 20 largest global dividend payers in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn addition to paying dividends, Apple repurchases a significant amount of its stock each year. It spent almost $70 billion on share repurchases in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The repurchases help to steadily reduce its outstanding shares.\nETF options\nETFs with exposure to Apple\nInstead of actively buying Apple shares directly, you can passively invest in the technology company through a fund holding its shares. As of mid-2024, Apple was the world's biggest company by market capitalization, at more than $3 trillion. Because of its huge market cap, it's a very widely held stock.\nApple is in several stock market indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Apple stock.\n\n Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\n \nAn exchange-traded fund, or ETF, allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once.\n\nAccording to ETF.com, 492 ETFs held 1.3 billion shares of Apple as of mid-2024.

Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.55%)(BRK.B -0.59%) is a holding company run by investing legend Warren Buffett. He took control of the former textile manufacturer in 1965 and transformed it into one of the largest companies in the world.\nBerkshire serves as his investment arm. Buffett uses the cash flows generated by Berkshire's operating businesses and investments to acquire other companies and make new investments that grow shareholder value.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway differs from other investment firms, like hedge funds. Anyone can invest in Berkshire Hathaway if they have enough money to buy at least one Class B share (more than $450 in late 2024).\nFor comparison, hedge funds are open only to accredited investors, meaning those with a high income or net worth and who can meet the fund's minimum investment, which can be $1 million or more. Berkshire Hathaway also doesn't charge exorbitant fees to its investors because it sees them as partners, not clients.\n\n Accredited Investor\n \nAn individual or entity that has a certain level of financial sophistication.\n\nBuffett's company has a tremendous track record of growing value for shareholders. From 1965 through 2023, Berkshire's shares delivered a 19.8% compound annual return.\nThat has outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 2-to-1 (the S&P 500 has produced a 10.2% compound annual return during that period). Here's a step-by-step guide on buying Berkshire Hathaway shares and some factors to consider before investing in the company.\n\nHow to buy\nHow to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock\nTo buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway, you must have a brokerage account. If you still need to open one, here are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms and a step-by-step guide to buying Berkshire Hathaway stock using Fidelity's five-star-rated platform.\nFidelity makes it easy to buy stocks. Its website offers a video tutorial and a step-by-step guide. Here's a screenshot of how to place a stock trade with Fidelity.\nImage source: Fidelity.\n\nOn this page, fill in all the relevant information, including:\nThe number of shares you want to buy or the amount you want to invest to purchase fractional shares.\nThe stock ticker symbol (BRK.B for Berkshire Hathaway).\nWhether you want to place a limit order or a market order. The Motley Fool recommends using a market order since it guarantees you buy shares immediately at the market price right at that moment.\nOnce you complete the order page, submit your order and become a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder.\n\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in Berkshire Hathaway?\nBefore buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway, you must determine whether you want to invest directly in the company. First, let's review a summary of the company's business model.\nBuffett and his investing partners use the money Berkshire's businesses earn for its shareholders and reinvest it in:\nBusinesses they can control by acquiring 100% ownership: Berkshire Hathaway's operating businesses include insurance, railroad, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service, and retailing. Notable brands include GEICO, BNSF, Pampered Chef, Pilot Travel Centers, Fruit of the Loom, and See's Candies.\nPublicly traded stocks topassively own pieces of high-quality businesses: Some of the top stocks Warren Buffett's company owned as of late 2024 included Apple (AAPL 1.82%), Bank of America (BAC -0.29%), Coca-Cola (KO -0.83%), Chevron (CVX -0.64%), American Express (AXP -1.15%), and Kraft Heinz (KHC -1.43%).\nReasons to invest in Berkshire\nHere are some reasons to consider purchasing the company's stock:\nYou believe Berkshire Hathaway can deliver a higher return than an S&P 500 index fund.\nYou like Warren Buffett's investment style and want to trust him and his team with your money.\nYou don't need to earn dividend income.\nYou believe Buffett and his team can put Berkshire's retained cash flows and cash balance to work in growing shareholder value over the long term.\nYou understand how Berkshire Hathaway makes money and want to follow the company.\nYou realize your investment in Berkshire Hathaway could lose money and might underperform the S&P 500.\nReasons not to invest in Berkshire\nOn the other hand, here are some factors to consider that might make you opt not to purchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway:\nYou're worried about Warren Buffett's age and whether his eventual successors will follow his blueprint for growing shareholder value.\nYou're concerned that the death of Buffett's long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, might affect the company's future performance.\nYou're nearing or in retirement and need dividend income.\nYou don't firmly believe Berkshire Hathaway can outperform the S&P 500 over the long term.\nYou are a younger, more growth-oriented investor and don't like Buffett's value investing approach.\nYou're too busy to follow Berkshire Hathaway and don't want to invest directly in individual stocks.\n\nProfitability\nIs Berkshire Hathaway profitable?\nProfit growth helps power stock price appreciation over the longer term. That makes it a good area for beginning investors to focus on before buying shares.\nBerkshire Hathaway is a consistently profitable company. Its operating profit rose 15% to $11.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The company benefited from higher insurance underwriting profits and increased interest income on its large cash balance.\n\nThe company retains all its earnings to allocate toward growing shareholder value. It also holds a lot of cash on its balance sheet -- a record $277 billion at the end of 2024's second quarter -- that it intends to deploy when it finds compelling investment opportunities. Berkshire's cash position ballooned after it cut its stake in Apple by almost 50% in the second quarter, raising a staggering $77 billion in cash.\nDividends\nDoes Berkshire Hathaway pay a dividend?\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway is a very profitable company, it doesn't pay dividends to its shareholders. CEO Warren Buffett believes he and his team can create more value for shareholders by retaining that cash and allocating it toward initiatives that create shareholder value.\n\n Dividend Payments\n \nThe distribution of a company's profits to its shareholders. Dividends are usually paid in cash but sometimes in company stock, as well.\n\nThose options include reinvesting it into existing businesses, making acquisitions, investing in publicly traded companies, or repurchasing shares when they trade at a discount to the company's estimated intrinsic value. The company bought back $345 million in stock during the second quarter of 2024, its lowest tally in years. It had repurchased $2.6 billion in the first quarter and $2.2 billion in the final period of 2023.\nETF options\nETFs with exposure to Berkshire Hathaway\nInstead of actively buying shares directly, you can passively invest in Berkshire Hathaway stock by investing in a fund holding its shares. Berkshire Hathaway is among the larger publicly traded companies by market capitalization, making it a widely held stock.\n\nBerkshire is in several stock market indexes, including the S&P 500 index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Berkshire Hathaway stock.\n\n Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\n \nAn exchange-traded fund, or ETF, allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once.\n\nAccording to ETF.com, 256 ETFs held a reported 140.3 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway in late 2024. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 0.03%) was the biggest holder, with more than 22 million shares.\nHowever, the ETF with the largest allocation to Berkshire Hathaway was the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF -0.3%), at more than 15% of the fund's total holdings. That compares to only about 1.7% from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, making the iShares U.S. Financials ETF a better option for investors seeking a more passive way to gain exposure to Berkshire Hathaway without directly buying shares.\nStock splits\nWill Berkshire Hathaway stock split?\nBerkshire Hathaway has never implemented a stock split for its Class A shares (BRK.A), which is one reason those shares traded at almost $700,000 apiece in late 2024. It will likely never split that class of its stock.\nHowever, in response to unit investment trusts that were formed to allow small investors to invest in Berkshire stock (and to make its stock more accessible to more investors), Berkshire created Class B shares (BRK.B) in 1996 with a much lower price point. The company has only split that stock class once. It completed a 50-for-1 split in 2010. At the time of the split, shares were trading at around $3,500.\n\nAs of late 2024, Berkshire had not announced an upcoming stock split. With the Class B shares trading at more than $450 a share, it doesn't seem likely that Berkshire will split its stock anytime soon, given its historical trend.\nRelated investment topics\n\n \n Top Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025\n \n \nGet a list of the best companies to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\n \n How to Invest in PayPal Stock\n \n \nGet step-by-step guidance on investing in PayPal stock and learn the ins-and-outs of this electronic payment company.\n\n \n Most Famous Investors in the World\n \n \nTake a look at some of the most famous investors in the world and what they have in common.\n\n \n How to Invest in Aldi in 2025\n \n \nHere's what you need to know about inves ..."}, {"title": "2 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Computer Industry", "source": {"name": "Zacks Investment Research", "homepage_url": "https://www.zacks.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"}, "url": "https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2073280/2-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-computer-industry", "content": "The Computer - Mini Computers industry is suffering from waning demand for PC, massive supply-chain and logistical issues, and geopolitical challenges.

Buffett is known as the Oracle of Omaha and is one of the most successful investors in history\nBuffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 in almost every year since 1965\nUsing the InvestingPro stock screener, I will highlight five companies that are worth adding to your portfolio if you want to invest following Buffett’s advice\nLooking for more top-rated stock ideas to add to your portfolio? Members of InvestingPro get exclusive access to our research tools and data. Learn More »\nWarren Buffett offers several tips for investing, including identifying companies with a competitive advantage, investing in what you know, buying for the long-term, and not overpaying for a company. I presented an Investing.com webinar earlier this week in which I provided a complete breakdown of Buffett’s investing principles and what he looks for in a company before deciding to purchase shares.\nYou can view all of the stocks in Buffett’s portfolio on InvestingPro. His five biggest holdings include, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and American Express (NYSE:AXP).\nAs such, using the InvestingPro stock screener, I ran a methodical approach to filter down the 7,500-plus stocks that are listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq into a small watchlist of established companies that have strong growth, solid profitability, healthy cash flows, and an attractive valuation.\nMy focus was on stocks with a market cap of $10 billion and above.\nI then scanned for companies whose InvestingPro Financial Health label was either ‘Great’ or ‘Excellent’. The InvestingPro Financial Health benchmark is an advanced stock ranking system that considers over 100 metrics pertaining to the company's growth, profitability, cash flow, and valuation, and then compares companies against each other. The best-performing companies on these metrics are the healthiest.\nA backtest that the InvestingPro team ran on the S&P 500 since 2016 showed that companies with the highest health grades outperformed the broader market by a wide margin: 233% for the healthiest companies vs. 101% for the benchmark index through Q3 2022. That’s a 20.3% annualized return compared to 11.4% for the S&P 500 over the past seven years.\nI then narrowed that down to companies with an InvestingPro Fair Value label of ‘Bargain’ or ‘Undervalued’. The grade is assigned based on the percentage upside when compared to the InvestingPro Fair Value estimate.\nAnd those names with Fair Value upside of at least 10% made our watchlist. The estimate is determined according to several valuation models, including price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-sales ratios, and price-to-book multiples.\nOnce the criteria were applied, we were left with a total of 32 companies.Source: InvestingPro\nHere are five stocks to consider adding to your portfolio if you want to invest following Buffett’s advice.\n1. Alphabet \nGoogle-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has what Warren Buffett calls a strong economic moat, which refers to companies with competitive advantages that protect them from rivals and enable them to earn outsized profits over time.\nThe online search giant, which is widely considered the leader in the digital adverting space, is one of the most dominant and profitable companies in the Internet media and services industry.\nThe Mountain View, California-based tech behemoth sports a near-perfect InvestingPro Financial Health score of 4/5 thanks to its dependently profitable business model and robust free cash flow.\nSource: InvestingPro \nIndeed, GOOGL stock could see an increase of around 30% in the next 12 months, according to the InvestingPro model, bringing it closer to its fair value of $130.67 per share.\nBuffett has admitted in the past that he should have had better insight into Google after not buying the stock years ago because it was outside his circle of competence.\n2. Verizon\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the largest wireless carrier in the U.S., ahead of AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), with 143.3 million subscribers as of the end of Q4 2022.\nThe telecommunications conglomerate is one of the top 15 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500. Not only do shares currently offer a market-beating yield of 6.78%, but the telecom giant has increased its annual dividend for 18 years in a row, a testament to strong execution across the company and its enormous cash pile.\nSource: InvestingPro \nAt a price point under $40, VZ comes at an extreme discount according to the quantitative models in InvestingPro, which point to upside of 18.2% in Verizon’s shares from current levels over the next 12 months.\nBuffett’s Berkshire initiated a position in Verizon in the past, purchasing 159 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Oracle of Omaha has since completely exited his position in the company.\n3. Bristol-Myers Squibb\nBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), which is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, checks off many of the boxes Warren Buffett looks for in a stock.\nThe New York City-based drug manufacturer currently owns several blockbuster drugs, each with over $1 billion in revenue, including its oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and fibrosis drugs.\nThe pharma giant is a quality dividend stock. BMY currently offers a quarterly payout of $0.57 per share, which implies an annualized dividend of $2.28 at a yield of 3.34%.\nNot surprisingly, BMY stock is substantially undervalued at the moment according to the quantitative models in InvestingPro and could see an upside of roughly 18% over the next 12 months to its fair value of $80.61/share.\nSource: InvestingPro \nLike Verizon, Bristol-Myers Squibb is another previous holding in Berkshire’s portfolio. Buffett loaded up on shares of BMY in 2020 before selling his stake in the drugmaker in 2022 as part of an overall trend in moving away from pharma stocks.\n4. Dow Inc\nDow Inc (NYSE:DOW) is among the three largest chemical producers in the world, with operations in more than 160 countries. Between its pristine balance sheet, enormous cash pile, strong dividend, and attractive valuation, Dow checks most of the marks on Warren Buffett’s list.\nThe global chemicals giant has proven over time that it can successfully navigate through uncertain economic environments and still provide investors with solid payouts thanks to its diverse business and rock-solid fundamentals.\n\nSource: InvestingPro \nDow currently offers an annualized dividend of $2.80 per share at a yield of 5.19%, one of the highest in the basic materials sector.\nAs could be expected, the average fair value for DOW stock on InvestingPro implies a nearly 25% upside from the current market value over the next 12 months.\n5. Steel Dynamics \nSteel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) is an American steel producer based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. With a production capacity of 13 million tons of steel, the company is the third largest manufacturer of carbon steel products in the U.S., making it a leading player in its industry.\nAs InvestingPro points out, Steel Dynamics is in excellent financial health condition, thanks to strong profit and growth prospects, combined with its reasonable valuation. Pro calls out a few more key insights on the stock, with the share buyback and dividend payout points standing out the most.\nSource: InvestingPro \nIn fact, Steel Dynamics has increased its annual dividend for 10 years in a row, proving that it can provide investors with higher dividend payouts regardless of the economic climate.\nThe quantitative models in InvestingPro point to a gain of 22.7% in STLD stock over the next 12 months, bringing shares closer to their fair value of $136.57.\n***\nDisclosure:At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ). I am also long on the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK).\nI regularly rebalance my portfolio of individual stocks and ETFs based on ongoing risk assessment of both the macroeconomic environment and companies' financials.\nThe views discussed in this article are solely the opinion of the author and should not be taken as investment advice.\n\nWarren Buffett Stocks: 5 Companies That Fit the Bill According to InvestingPro\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,917.50\n+83.3\n+0.18%\n\nUS 500 \n6,588.90\n+4.6\n+0.07%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.19\n+0.43\n+2.91%\n\nDollar Index \n97.137\n-0.009\n-0.01%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.82\n+0.13\n+0.21%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.08\n+0.09\n+0.13%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.956\n+0.015\n+0.51%\n\nGold Futures\n3,680.62\n-5.78\n-0.16%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.65\n-0.180\n-0.42%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6535\n+0.0015\n+0.03%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.25\n-5.75\n-0.55%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.064\n+0.005\n+0.12%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.687\n+0.008\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.628\n+0.003\n+0.08%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.04\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.25\n-0.03\n-0.03%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.81\n-0.07\n-0.06%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
