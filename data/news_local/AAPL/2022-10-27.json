seems, on what AMZN and AAPL do after the close. I don‚Äôt have positions in either of these. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for one thing, is utterly inscrutable to me. I mean, just look at the past year and a half of its trading. There‚Äôs no pattern. No bottom. No top. It‚Äôs just meandering along listlessly, going up and down without any rhyme or reason. So my prediction: no clue!\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), on the other hand, at least has somewhat of a pattern. I‚Äôve tinted the rather substantial top, but it‚Äôs been banging around beneath it for months now. Of the two stocks, I‚Äôd say this one is more likely to actually tumble, as opposed to Apple, which has the dynamism of a passbook savings account.\n\nNeedless to say, if both stocks do well, then declarations of¬†the bear market is over¬†will be on everyone‚Äôs lips, and the bears will have yet another miserable Friday.\n\nApple And Amazon: Dynamic Duo Or Gruesome Twosome?\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,902.00\n+67.8\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,595.10\n+10.8\n+0.16%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.07\n+0.31\n+2.10%\n\nDollar Index \n97.112\n-0.034\n-0.03%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.78\n+0.09\n+0.14%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.32\n+0.33\n+0.49%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.973\n+0.032\n+1.09%\n\nGold Futures\n3,679.00\n-7.40\n-0.20%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.715\n-0.115\n-0.27%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6625\n+0.0105\n+0.23%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,045.38\n-0.88\n-0.08%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.078\n+0.019\n+0.47%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.696\n+0.017\n+0.36%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.633\n+0.008\n+0.22%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.20\n-0.08\n-0.07%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.67\n-0.22\n-0.17%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
