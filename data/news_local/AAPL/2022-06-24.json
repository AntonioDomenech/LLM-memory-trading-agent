You probably notice that one of my three pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling a story in that third dimension, that lean forward interactive dimension. So, it is absolutely top of mind.”\nBut in the fiscal year, second-quarter earnings call featuring Chapek that was conducted on May 11, no question was raised concerning the metaverse and no information was volunteered by Chapek on what progress was made by Disney in this area since the earlier call.\nAnd the word metaverse was nowhere to be found in the company’s fiscal year, second-quarter earnings report — nor, for that matter, were the words non-fungible tokens or NFTs.\nThis absence is curious, given Chapek’s advocacy of “technological innovation” in his fiscal year, first-quarter earnings call and his enthusiasm for the subject in a Fortune interview from January. But that’s not to say Disney has retreated from the digital environments of NFTs and the metaverse — it’s just that the company’s forward movement is occurring at a somewhat leisurely pace.\nSee Also: Disney Moving Forward With New 'Planet Of The Apes' Trilogy\nIn Search Of Disney: Rebekah Barton, senior entertainment editor for the Inside the Magic blog that focuses on all things Disney, recalled being intrigued on the February earnings call, although she wondered why there was no depth to Chapek’s pronouncement.\n“It was sort of intriguing because it was like they were trying to stay ahead of the curve,” she recalled. “But there wasn't a lot of concrete detail given. Whether that's because they simply weren't ready to share or because it's actually not ready, I can't know.”\nChapek’s lack of detail was on display earlier in a January interview with Fortune where he spoke enthusiastically — if vaguely — about the subject.\n“The precursor to everything we’re talking about with the metaverse and this customer-personalized blending of physical and digital is the database,” said Chapek, who viewed data mining as his key to success.\n“We’ve been collecting very deep, rich data for a long time from our parks. When you sign on to Disney+, we know who you are. We’ve got volumes of hard data that tell us exactly what were the first streams, when did the first streams come on, how long did people watch, how many times did they watch?\n“We’ve got a combination of broad data and deep data, and ..."}, {"title": "Better Buy: Amazon or All 19,941 Cryptocurrencies?", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/06/24/better-buy-amazon-or-all-19941-cryptocurrencies/", "content": "The bear market has brought cryptos and Amazon's stock price a long way down from their highs."}, {"title": "Here's how much S&P 500 companies that make most of their money in U.S. have outperformed their global-faced rivals", "source": {"name": "MarketWatch", "homepage_url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/marketwatch.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/marketwatch.ico"}, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buy-american-has-been-a-better-stock-picking-strategy-than-the-alternative-here-are-the-companies-most-exposed-to-the-u-s-economy-11656067910", "content": "Multinational is one thing, but 2022 hasn’t been the year for stocks to have a truly international presence."}, {"title": "3 Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool", "homepage_url": "https://www.fool.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"}, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/06/24/3-cathie-wood-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-long-haul/", "content": "The market might be beaten down, but this top technology investor remains bullish."}, {"title": "Inflation Doesn't Spare Music Either: Apple Quietly Jacks Up Prices For Students", "source": {"name": "Benzinga", "homepage_url": "https://www.benzinga.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"}, "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/06/27838809/inflation-doesnt-spare-music-either-apple-quietly-jacks-up-prices-for-students", "content": "An Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) plan meant for students who use its Music app is the latest to fall victim to creeping inflation.\nWhat Happened: The Tim Cook-led company will now charge students $5.99 instead of the $4.99 it charged previously, reported AppleInsider. \nThe price hike was noted by app developer Michael Burkhardt who said in a Twitter thread that Apple raised prices for the Student plan in some countries, but not in the United ..."}]}
