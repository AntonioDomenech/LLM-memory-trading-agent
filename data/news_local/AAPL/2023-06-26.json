Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nAMD\n1.86%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nHIVE\n12.72%\n\nBTC/USD\n-1.10%\n\nEthereum US

Web3 promises to be such an environment and to understand this shift, it's helpful for investors to consider the evolution of the internet.\nThe first phase, Web1, offered users unprecedented access to information and connectivity (think AOL, Yahoo! and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)). Then came Web2, which enhanced the experience by allowing personalized, user-generated content to be delivered through apps (think Facebook (NASDAQ:META) and Twitter). As the next iteration, Web3 operates on a global, peer-to-peer infrastructure made possible by blockchain technology. Like Bitcoin, the Web3 network is decentralized, meaning it eliminates intermediaries; no single entity controls it. At its core, Web3 aims to address data monopoly, privacy risks and algorithmic bias, promoting a more equitable and open Internet. We'll see a shift from platform-centric to individual-centric data and identity management, leading to new technologies and business models.\nBut to truly establish this network, users‚Äîboth people and machines‚Äîneed to actively participate. To do this, developers may use tokens (think Ether or Polkadot) to manage activity and record transactions on the blockchain. Other key components of this next-generation ecosystem could also include smart contracts and digital wallets.\nInvestment in Web3 Companies\nBlockchain technology, with its ‚Äútrustless‚Äù systems, has been seen as a remedy for growing mistrust in various traditional institutions. Yet recent failures by crypto-related firms, including FTX and Silvergate, have sparked investor uncertainty in digital assets, casting a shadow over the future of Web3.\nLook at the chart below, taken from a recent report by Deloitte. Early-stage investors poured around $94 billion into Web3 companies between 2016 and 2022, most of it in the last two years, with investment peaking at $13 billion in the first quarter of 2022. This corresponds to Bitcoin‚Äôs plunge in price after hitting its all-time high of nearly $69,000.\n\nHowever, as Deloitte points out, there are parallels between the slump in digital asset prices and the dotcom crash of the early 2000s. Just as the internet became integral to life and work over time, the transformative potential of Web3 is likely to continue, attracting venture capital and private equity investors.\nAI, the Rising Star of Corporate America and the Metaverse\nThe buzz around artificial intelligence (AI) has also been growing, and it shows in corporate America. An analysis of earnings conference calls for the first quarter of 2023 reveals a significant uptick in the number of S&P 500 companies discussing AI. During this period, 110 companies mentioned AI, a notable increase from the five-year average of 57 and the 10-year average of 34, according to an analysis by FactSet.\n\nAlong those same lines, the development of real-time, 3D virtual applications by companies like Meta, Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to boost spending on AI servers, which are already projected to grow 19% annually through 2032. This is due to increasing demand for generative AI from popular applications such as ChatGPT and Midjourney.\nIn case you‚Äôre wondering, ‚Äúgenerative AI‚Äù refers to applications that can create unique content from simple prompts submitted by users. As I shared with you earlier this year, ChatGPT is the fastest-growing app in history, reaching 100 million users in as little as two months after launch.\n\nTo run efficiently, these metaverse applications will need advanced graphics and AI processors, increasing investments in high-performance AI chips from companies such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and in data center operators such as HIVE Blockchain Technologies (NASDAQ:HIVE). According to projections by Bloomberg Intelligence, AI server spending could account for nearly 30% of total workload expenditures by 2032, a significant increase from approximately 15% in 2022.\n\nGenerative AI Could Be a $4 Trillion to $7 Trillion Industry\nBut what can generative AI be used for in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù? McKinsey & Co. found 63 such AI uses across 16 business functions, and if applied, they could create between $2.6 and $4.4 trillion in economic benefits on an annual basis. This would add 15% to 40% to the current $11 to $17.7 trillion potential value from non-generative AI and analytics.\nGoldman Sachs‚Äôs projections are even more optimistic. According to the bank, advancements in generative AI could significantly impact the world economy, leading to a 7% rise in global GDP (equivalent to nearly $7 trillion) and a 1.5% increase in productivity growth over a decade.\nAs one such use case, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) just last week announced the launch of the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, a $100 million initiative aimed at helping customers develop and implement generative AI solutions. This move forms part of the company‚Äôs broader strategy to expand the accessibility of generative AI to customers and partners worldwide.\nPeople Adopting New Technology at a Faster Pace\nSome readers might understandably feel bewildered by all of this, but it‚Äôs worth remembering that technological cycles have emerged every 10-15 years. Web3, AI and digital assets are no exception.\nGranted, widespread adoption of Web3, AI and assets such as Bitcoin won‚Äôt be easy. The primary roadblock is likely user experience. The process of setting up crypto wallets, for instance, can be complex and demanding, and standard web browsers may not even support Web3 without additional plug-ins.\nTo encourage mass adoption, Web3 needs to provide a user-friendly interface comparable to the shift from Web1 to the current, more interactive version of the internet. This transition could be led by major tech companies like Meta, which understand the potential benefits of simplifying Web3 for everyday users.\nThe good news is that people appear to be getting better at adopting new technologies. A 2013 study from MIT's Technology Review confirms this trend. It took telephones half a century to become commonplace in American homes, for instance, whereas smartphones reached 40% penetration in just 10 years.\n\nSimilarly, I expect things to move fast when it comes to digital transformation. A survey conducted last summer found that 75% of retailers planned to accept digital currencies as payment within the next two years. Blockchain technology, the backbone of Web3, is anticipated to usher in a new digital era, with a potential global user base of 1 billion by 2031, according to Andreessen Horowitz. (For comparison‚Äôs sake, the internet reached 1 billion users in 2005.)\n***\nHoldings may change daily. Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter-end.

A growing number of companies are relying on chatbots to streamline and improve their customer service. Read on to find out more about chatbots, including the different types of chatbots and some chatbot innovations.\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\nWhat are they?\nWhat are chatbots?\nA chatbot is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to imitate a conversation with a human, generally through online text or voice applications. Chatbots range widely in sophistication, from text messages that answer a simple query with a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù to programs that are capable of having a lighthearted conversation.\nChatbots have their origins in work done by famed mathematician Alan Turing, who created a test to classify machines as intelligent, with the main criteria being that a person couldn‚Äôt tell if they were communicating with a human or a machine. Barely a decade after Turing‚Äôs death in 1954, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence Laboratory developed ELIZA, a program capable of responding to questions like a psychotherapist.\nThe programs have continued to evolve, along with the explosive growth of applications that use artificial intelligence. Only a few short years ago, a question about the weather to a chatbot might result in a simple forecast. These days, a chatbot might go so far as to suggest packing an umbrella and setting the alarm clock a little early to account for a slower commute.\n\nTypes\nTypes of chatbots\nSoftware giant Oracle (ORCL -5.05%) defines two main types of chatbots:\nTask-oriented chatbots: These programs have one function. They use rules, natural language processing, and a small amount of machine learning to generate responses to customer questions. They‚Äôre the most common type of chatbot. They can be used to provide basic information to customers, such as hours of operation for a business, policies for exchanges and returns, and account information.\nData-driven and predictive chatbots: These are often more sophisticated and interactive versions of chatbots that can learn user needs over time and even anticipate future requirements. Common examples are Siri, the virtual assistant created by Apple (AAPL 1.82%), and Alexa, the digital helper from Amazon (AMZN -0.74%).\nRelated investing topics\n\n \n Investing in AI Stocks: A Comprehensive Guide to the Future of Technology\n \n \nLearn how you can make money from the wave of seasoned companies innovating in AI and new AI tech companies.\n\n \n 10 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a Compelling Way\n \n \nLearn about how some of the biggest companies in the world are using AI.\n\n \n Investing in Tech Stocks\n \n \nThis vast sector is composed of some of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nExample\nChatbot example\nAlthough most attention lately has focused on ChatGPT, an AI-driven tool released in 2022 by OpenAI, both large and small companies have been using increasingly sophisticated chatbots for several years now.\nConsider the often not-so-humble cup of Starbucks (SBUX -0.56%) coffee. The Seattle-based coffee giant reports that 25% of all transactions are conducted as mobile orders that are made through its app -- roughly 1 million cups of coffee every day of the year.\nThe chatbot, which is part of its mobile app, first appeared in 2017 and was designed to cut down on everyone‚Äôs favorite pastime of standing in an endless Starbucks line. The chatbot now supports natural language processing, so customers can make orders by voice and text. Payments are made with a linked credit card or gift card, and the order can be sent to the closest store. The chatbot‚Äôs artificial intelligence can even anticipate whether it‚Äôs a caramel frappuccino or grande Americano kind of day for you.\n\n The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon, Apple, Oracle, and Starbucks.
