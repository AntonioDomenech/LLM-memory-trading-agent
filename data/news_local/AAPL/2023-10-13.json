earnings season unofficially kicks off on Friday, October 13, when the big banks report their latest results.\nAnalysts expect a 0.3% yearly profit decline and an increase of 1.7% in revenue growth.\nI used the InvestingPro stock screener to find high quality stocks poised to deliver robust profit and revenue growth amid the current climate.\nLooking for more actionable trade ideas to navigate the current market volatility? Members of InvestingPro get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate. Learn More ¬ª\nGet ready for more volatility; the next major test for the stock market is upon us.\nWall Street's third quarter earnings season unofficially begins on Friday, October 13, when notable names like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) all report their latest financial results.\nThe following week sees high-profile companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines report earnings.\nThe earnings season gathers momentum in the final week of the month when the mega-cap tech companies are scheduled to deliver their Q3 updates. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are both due on Tuesday, October 24, followed by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday, October 25, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday, October 26. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be the final ‚ÄòFAAMG‚Äô stock to report results on Thursday, November 2.\nInvestors are bracing for what may be another rocky reporting season amid the negative impact of several macroeconomic headwinds.\nAfter earnings per share for the S&P 500 fell 4.1% in Q2 2023, earnings are expected to drop 0.3% in Q3 when compared to the same period last year, according to FactSet estimates.\nSource: FactSet\nIf 0.3% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings declines reported by the index. However, it would be the smallest decline during this four-quarter streak.\nThe Communication Services sector, which includes names like Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), is expected to report the largest third-quarter earnings gain, at 31.5%.\nThe Consumer Discretionary sector is expected to come in second, with 22% annualized earnings growth. The space includes notable companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald‚Äôs (NYSE:MCD)s, and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\nFor bank results, where earnings are forecast to grow 8.7%, FactSet says to expect weak loan growth, especially mortgages, and rising loan-loss provisions, offset by ‚Äúdraconian cost-control programs,‚Äù which could help the sector step over a low bar on earnings.\nOn the other hand, energy company earnings are expected to fall 37.7% compared to last year - the worst drop of any sector by far. Lower year-over-year oil prices are contributing to the decrease in earnings for the sector. Despite the recent rally, the average price of oil in Q3 2023 ($82.22) was still 10% below the average price in Q3 2022 ($91.43).\nMeanwhile, revenue expectations are slightly more positive, with sales growth expected to increase 1.7% from the same quarter a year earlier. If that is in fact the reality, FactSet pointed out that it would mark the 11th straight quarter of revenue growth for the index.\n\nSource: FactSet\nNine sectors are projected to report year-over-year growth in revenues, led by the Consumer Discretionary sector, at 7%. In contrast, two sectors are predicted to report a y-o-y decline in revenues: Energy and Materials.\nGuidance\nBeyond the top-and-bottom-line numbers, investors will pay close attention to announcements on forward guidance for the rest of the year and early 2024, given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, which has seen recession fears mount lately.\nOther key issues likely to come up will be the health of the U.S. consumer, future hiring plans, as well as lingering supply chain concerns.\nAnother key concern for investors is the impact of a rallying U.S. dollar on overseas revenue. A strong greenback can hurt U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by making those products less affordable.\nMore than a quarter of the companies in the S&P 500 earn a majority of their revenue outside the U.S., as per FactSet.\nMeanwhile, in the tech sector, artificial intelligence is likely to be a big theme again. Investors will look to see if companies can turn optimism over AI developments into an improved bottom line.\nWhat to Do Now?\nMarkets are heading into the Q3 reporting season on a wobbly note amid worries over rising interest rates and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve could keep rates high for longer.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is down roughly 6% from its late-July highs, cutting its year-to-date gain to 12%. The pullback has wiped out most of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average‚Äôs 2023 gains.\n\nAmid the current backdrop, I used the InvestingPro stock screener to search for companies that are poised to deliver annualized growth of at least 25% or more in both profit and sales as the third quarter earnings season kicks off.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nInvestingPro's stock screener is a powerful tool that can assist investors in identifying high quality stocks with strong potential upside. By utilizing this tool, investors can filter through a vast universe of stocks based on specific criteria and parameters.\nSome of the notable tech-related names to make the list include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), and Cloudflare (NYSE:NET).\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL), Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) are a few consumer-sensitive stocks to watch out for that are also projected to deliver upbeat Q3 earnings and revenue growth.\n\nFor the full list of the 18 stocks that met my criteria, start your free 7-day trial with InvestingPro to unlock must-have insights and data!\nIf you're already an InvestingPro subscriber, you can view my selections here.\nHere is the link for those of you who would like to subscribe to InvestingPro and start analyzing stocks yourself.\n***\nWith InvestingPro, you can conveniently access a single-page view of complete and comprehensive information about different companies all in one place, eliminating the need to gather data from multiple sources and saving you time and effort.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am short on the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000 via theProShares Short S&P 500 ETF (SH), ProShares Short QQQ ETF (PSQ), and ProShares Short Russell 2000 ETF (RWM). \nAdditionally, I have a long position on the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLE) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLV).

Markets\n\nPublished10/13/2023, 08:54 AM\n\nArm Holdings Already Has 40% Upside\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nMarketBeat.com\nArticles(5360)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nARM\n-2.62%\n\nThe year‚Äôs biggest IPO has given investors plenty to chew on.\nShares have been under pressure this month, but the outlook is bullish.\nThe risk/reward profile is also bright and supports the long side.\nWith just over 20 days of public trading under their belt, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have already been on a rollercoaster. As the biggest IPO of the year, there were plenty of eyes watching when they floated last month, and expectations were high.\nArm is one of the brightest stars of the British tech scene and the UK‚Äôs only real chip maker of any significance. Their chips are used across a range of devices, including most of the world‚Äôs smartphones, and compete against the likes of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, for a while last year, there were talks of the latter acquiring Arm, so for them to make it to the public market on their own eventually is a bold statement.\nIt remains to be seen, however, if Arm can also deliver the eye-watering gains that NVIDIA has been giving to shareholders in recent months.\nFirst Few Days\nIn a hark back to the golden days of tech IPOs, Arm‚Äôs shares did deliver on the hype in their first few days of trading, jumping 35% from their IPO price of $51. But the honeymoon period ended pretty quickly, and they‚Äôre less than a dollar away from dropping below their IPO price after a 25% fall.\nTo be fair, equities, in general, traded down at the end of September, so you could say it‚Äôs been a case of unfortunate timing for Arm, who got caught up in the slide. But with both the broader market, as seen with the benchmark S&P 500 index, and chip stocks in general starting to turn north again in the past week, it‚Äôs a good time to see what the outlook is like for Arm shares heading into the rest of the year. \nOne of the most bullish calls out there is from the team at J.P. Morgan, who initiated their coverage of Arm earlier this week with a $70 price target. From where shares were due to open on Friday, this points to an upside of around 40%, not bad for a freshly floated company that‚Äôs still finding its feet.\nStrong Profile\nAnalyst Harlan Sur is a big fan of how embedded Arm chips already are with the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) smartphones, while at the same time, the company is driving for further diversification with broader computer, networking and memory products. Sur is looking for at least 18% revenue growth over the next three years and expects the company to strengthen its foothold in multiple industries, such as auto, IOT, and data centers, along the way.\nBank of America echoed this with their Buy rating on Arm shares and shared a compound annual growth rate target of 43% through 2025. This would be a full 1.5x what its chipmaking peers are targeting but is more than doable given Arm commands higher royalty rates and strong relationships with the big customers.\nGetting Involved\nAgainst these bullish calls, there has been some caution urged, with the likes of Susquehanna rating them a Neutral and Bernstein going all the way to an Underperform rating. A key concern, shared by both, revolves around how much of the company‚Äôs revenue, 25% last year, comes from the Chinese market and how this might be adversely affected by any escalation in geopolitical tensions there.\nBut this is something all the chip makers are dealing with to some extent or another, and it‚Äôs hard to argue that the risk/reward setup isn‚Äôt attractive right now. Yesterday, Arm shares found themselves back by their IPO level for the tenth time since IPO‚Äôing.\nOn each previous occasion, there have been plenty of buyers who stepped in, and short of a broader market sell-off, you‚Äôd expect the same this time. If the bears are unable to take shares below $51 in the coming sessions definitively, momentum should swing hard to the upside. NVIDIA shares are currently rallying hard towards fresh all-time highs, which bodes well for other chipmakers, so it‚Äôs fair to expect Arm to follow shortly in their slipstream.\nOriginal Post\n\nArm Holdings Already Has 40% Upside\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,893.50\n+59.3\n+0.13%\n\nUS 500 \n6,594.10\n+9.8\n+0.15%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n14.76\n+0.05\n+0.34%\n\nDollar Index \n97.195\n+0.049\n+0.05%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.69\n0.00\n0.00%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.22\n+0.23\n+0.34%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.969\n+0.028\n+0.95%\n\nGold Futures\n3,674.60\n-11.80\n-0.32%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.688\n-0.142\n-0.33%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6575\n+0.0055\n+0.12%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,044.13\n-2.13\n-0.20%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.082\n+0.023\n+0.57%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.706\n+0.027\n+0.58%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.646\n+0.021\n+0.58%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.035\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.13\n-0.16\n-0.14%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.64\n-0.25\n-0.19%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
