earnings make a comeback at the halfway point\n\nOutlier earnings dates next week - MODG, LYFT, LNT, WEN, YELP, HBI, CNK\n\n1,282 companies expected to report during the second peak week of the Q4 season\n\nThe Q4 earnings season has done an about-face after starting out a little rough with disappointing banking results. Better-than-expected reports in the last two weeks have been driving US stocks to new highs. On Thursday the S&P 500 crossed the 5,000 mark for the first time ever in intraday trading.\nLast week's notable winners were once again concentrated in the tech and tech-adjacent spaces, with AI-focused companies leading the group. Recently IPO'd Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) smashed quarterly expectations and issued bullish guidance for the current quarter. Arm's chips are found in many smartphone and PC devices, and they count giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among their customers. Arm has benefitted from the race towards artificial intelligence as companies require more robust processors to support development. The stock catapulted nearly 50% in the day after its report.\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is another AI-centric company that blew results out of the water last week. The company surpassed revenue expectations on the back of strong demand for its AI tools, typically from defense and intelligence branches of the U.S. government. CEO Alex Karp said the demand for large language models \"continues to be unrelenting.\"\nOther standouts last week were consumer focused, perhaps giving some clues around the health of the US consumer just ahead of major retail reports. Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) pleased investors by reporting an uptick in premium subscribers. Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) saw shares climb after reporting a stake in Epic Games as well as the planned launch of an ESPN streaming service in 2025 and an exclusive release of Taylor Swift's Era's Tour movie. Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) showed certain pockets of apparel are still strong after their earnings beat came from a mix of price increases and strength from China. Fellow apparel company, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (UAA), noted weakness in sales, but it was proposed cost cutting and increased profit expectations that took shares higher on Thursday. In contrast, other consumer-centered businesses such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) suffered poor results due to the Middle Eastern conflict and falling sales due to boycotts in that region.\nAs a result of better-than-expected reports last week, the FactSet blended S&P 500 EPS consensus now stands at 2.9%, an uptick from 1.6% the week prior.[8]\nMore Earnings on Deck\nWe get results from a smattering of industries this week including enterprise tech (Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY), HubSpot Inc (NYSE:HUBS), Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO)), travel & leisure (Airbnb¬†Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), Tripadvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR)), restaurants (The Wendy‚Äôs Co (NASDAQ:WEN), Shake Shack Inc (NYSE:SHAK)) and more.\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\nOutlier Earnings Dates This Week\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies that have pushed their Q4 2023 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. However, only one of those companies is listed on the S&P 500. Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT) is set to report Thursday, February 15, a week earlier than usual, therefore giving it a positive DateBreaks Factor*.\nThere are also several consumer-focused companies reporting later-than-usual next week. Those names are Topgolf Callaway Brands (NYSE:MODG), Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), The Wendy's Company, Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP), Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) and Cinemark Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CNK).\nQ4 Earnings Wave\nThis season peak weeks will fall between January 29 - March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently February 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 549 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 69% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 32% have reported (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names). Roughly 67% of the S&P 500 has reported.\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nQ4 Earning‚Äãs Season Coming up Roses\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,907.50\n+73.3\n+0.16%\n\nUS 500 \n6,593.30\n+9.0\n+0.14%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.10\n+0.34\n+2.30%\n\nDollar Index \n97.02\n-0.126\n-0.13%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.76\n+0.07\n+0.11%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.01\n+0.02\n+0.03%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.946\n+0.005\n+0.17%\n\nGold Futures\n3,678.02\n-8.38\n-0.23%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.668\n-0.163\n-0.38%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6543\n+0.0023\n+0.05%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.88\n-5.13\n-0.49%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.28\n0.00\n0.00%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.74\n-0.14\n-0.11%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what‚Äôs moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
