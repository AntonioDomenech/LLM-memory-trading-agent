comments (17)17\n\nMichael Kramer\nArticles(1667)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nQQQ\n0.44%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nIXIC\n0.44%\n\nROKU\n-1.94%\n\nDOCU\n-0.06%\n\nThe stock market witnessed a dramatic sell-off on Friday after a big rally in the morning. The S&P had been up as much as 1.3%, and around 12 PM ET, everything began to fall apart.\n\nBlame it on the Nord Stream pipeline shutdown news, but the selling started 20 minutes before the news hit, with the index dropping nearly 50 bps. I think the turn lower had already been in place, but clearly, the news didn‚Äôt help.\n\nIt is hard to determine how the market will open on Tuesday or if the narrative will shift. However, that significant support level at 3,920 is still big, and if we gap below that, I think the declines could accelerate with the next stop coming at 3,830 and potentially lower than that. I believe we are currently in a minor wave five down, and if that is the case, then we should see 3,830 in the days ahead, regardless of how we open tomorrow.\n\nPowell\nPowell will speak on Thursday in a Q&A session with the Cato Institute, so I think these will be serious questions, not softballs. He will likely be asked about the coming FOMC meeting and his thoughts on the job report. Although I am not sure, he will tip his hand on a 50 or 75-bps rate hike at the next meeting. He could say something like the job data was strong, and if we get a CPI report as expected, then he thinks a 75 bps rate hike is warranted, but I‚Äôm not sure he will even go that far. The CPI report comes during the FOMC blackout period, and I don‚Äôt think he wants to find himself in the same position he was in for the June meeting.\nNasdaq\nThe cumulative number of stocks on the Nasdaq making new highs minus new lows is on the decline again, and typically when this happens, it results in a new leg lower for the Nasdaq. It could be the case yet again.\n\nThe QQQ, like the S&P 500, is sitting on a critical support level at the $295 region. A break of support opens a short-term window to $289.\n\nDocuSign\nDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) is one such name that has recently made a new low. It is expected to report results on September 8. DOCU could be a good stock to watch, if nothing else, just from a pure sentiment gauge. Given that the shares are in the middle of filling a gap down to $46, it doesn‚Äôt exactly provide one with much confidence.\n\nRoku\nThe good news for Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) is that it hasn‚Äôt made a new 52-week low. The bad news is that despite breaking a massive long-term downtrend and breaking out of a falling wedge, which should have been bullish. Instead, all the stock could do was trade sideways, not good, which means the chances of a new low and dropping to $58 are increasing.\n\nTesla\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) broke the neckline on the Head And Shoulders pattern, which could push the shares down to $246 or another 12%.\n\nApple\nFinally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release its new iPhone series this week. But more importantly, the stock may have given us a sneak peek of what to expect from the market. Unlike the S&P 500 and the QQQ ETF, Apple‚Äôs shares closed below support on Friday, which could signify that the indexes are likely to follow. After all, if Apple starts heading lower towards $152, I think the entire market will follow Apple down.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nUnclear Market Narrative\n\nView all comments (17)17\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,918.00\n+83.8\n+0.18%\n\nUS 500 \n6,588.30\n+4.0\n+0.06%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.21\n+0.45\n+3.05%\n\nDollar Index \n97.157\n+0.011\n+0.01%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.90\n+0.21\n+0.33%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.19\n+0.20\n+0.30%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.956\n+0.015\n+0.51%\n\nGold Futures\n3,681.50\n-4.90\n-0.13%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.67\n-0.160\n-0.37%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6535\n+0.0015\n+0.03%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.50\n-5.50\n-0.53%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.068\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.687\n+0.008\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.628\n+0.003\n+0.08%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.04\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.22\n-0.06\n-0.06%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.78\n-0.10\n-0.08%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
