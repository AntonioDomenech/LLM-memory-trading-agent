Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nINTC\n-2.15%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nCSCO\n-1.71%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nIBM\n-1.39%\n\nSPLK\n0.00%\n\nWDAY\n-1.45%\n\nAMBA\n-3.33%\n\nRDFN\n-0.36%\n\nIt’s been a busy few weeks for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and it’s about to stay that way for the remainder of June. The AI computing company is in the midst of a month-long event cluster which started with earnings on May 24 and will end with their annual shareholder meeting on June 22.\nWall Street Horizon has found that while a standalone event such as a company’s upcoming earnings release date may affect volatility, investigating multiple events closely in relationship to one another can have a stronger impact on a company’s corporate financial health. Observing the information pre-event, during the event and post-event and how they interact is critical to understand how events relate to trading and risk strategies. Currently, we see a bullish event cluster lining up for NVDA.\nAfter posting stellar earnings on May 24 and briefly joining the trillion-dollar market cap club on May 30 alongside Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia will be hot on the conference scene over the next two weeks, which includes a speaking slot at today’s Bank of America Securities Global Technology Conference in San Francisco.\nMay 24 - FQ1 2024 Earnings Report and Conference Call\nNvidia’s month-long event cluster officially kicked off with their earnings report on May 24 which blew expectations out of the water. The supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) recorded FQ1 2024 EPS of $1.09, well ahead of expectations for $0.92. Revenues also surpassed expectations, coming in at $7.2B vs. an estimate of $6.5B.\nThe company noted that performance was supported by surging demand for GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as other internet companies that use them for generative AI applications such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. These AI chips are becoming a necessity for any company that manages data centres and large numbers of servers.\nMay 29 - June 2 - Computex Taipei\nLast week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joined Computex Taipei as the opening keynote speaker where he made a number of announcements from chip release dates to upcoming partnerships. The major focus was NVDA’s data center applications such as AI GPUs and the ‘Nvidia Omniverse.’ Other products that Nvidia is well known for, such as gaming chips, were not mentioned as heavily expected, with no news on their upcoming RTX 4060 GPU.\nHuang was not the only speaker from Nvidia at this year’s Computex, however. Greg Estes, VP of Corporate Marketing and Developer Programs gave a talk on day two of the conference entitled \"Racing Towards the Industrial Metaverse.” In an extension of some themes from Huang’s talk, Estes focused on how NVDA and their partners are currently using Omniverse, generative AI and accelerated computing.\nJune 6 - Bank of America Securities Global Technology Conference 2023\n9:20 AM PDT speaking time, San Francisco\nWhile it hasn’t been made public who will be speaking on Nvidia’s behalf, last year CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote address at this conference which is a who’s who of the tech industry. Nvidia will be in good company again this year as the agenda includes talks from industry execs at other big tech names such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and more.\nJune 7 - Rosenblatt Securities 3rd Annual Technology Summit - The Age of AI (Part I)\n12:00 - 12:45p EDT speaking time, virtual\nThe very next day, Nvidia’s VP & GM of Hyperscale & HPC, Ian Buck, will join the Rosenblatt Securities 3rd Annual Technology Summit for a virtual fireside chat from 12-12:45 EDT.\nJune 12 - New Street Research’s Future of Transportation Conference\n12:00 - 12:30p ET, virtual\nOn June 12, Nvidia’s VP & GM of Automotive, Ali Kani, will speak at New Street Research’s Future of Transportation conference on the topic of Autonomous Technologies.\nJune 22 - Annual Shareholder Meeting\n11:00 AM PDT, Virtual\nOn June 22, Nvidia will hold their annual shareholder meeting virtually.\nConference season mostly wraps up ahead of summer break in July and August. After their shareholder meeting, the next time we are likely to hear an update from Nvidia is on their FQ2 2024 earnings call on August 23.\n\nAI Darling Nvidia Is Everywhere This Conference Season​\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,899.50\n+65.3\n+0.14%\n\nUS 500 \n6,592.90\n+8.6\n+0.13%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.09\n+0.33\n+2.24%\n\nDollar Index \n97.015\n-0.131\n-0.13%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.81\n+0.12\n+0.19%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.08\n+0.09\n+0.13%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.952\n+0.011\n+0.37%\n\nGold Futures\n3,679.10\n-7.30\n-0.20%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.663\n-0.167\n-0.39%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.655\n+0.0030\n+0.06%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.75\n-5.25\n-0.50%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.28\n0.00\n0.00%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.74\n-0.14\n-0.11%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
