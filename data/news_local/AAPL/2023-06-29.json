AM\n\nApple's Bull Run Is Different From Other Tech Giants\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nMarketBeat.com\nArticles(5360)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nGS\n-0.60%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nGoogle and Tesla were both downgraded this week despite big rallies.\nApple's fundamentals put them in a different class, however.\nThe technical setup is just as strong, and this rally is still young.\nA funny thing has been happening on Wall Street recently. Some of the biggest and brightest tech stocks have received cautious downgrades from analysts despite posting significant returns this year as downtrends are broken and strong uptrends emerge.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for example, received two downgrades this week, even though its shares have rallied as much as 50% since January. Similarly, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, despite gaining as much as 170% this year alone, were downgraded by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Monday. Investors would be forgiven for thinking that rallies that simply strengthened the bull's case rather than undermined it, so it's understandable that some of the other tech titans who've posted strong returns this year already might be getting nervous.\nStrong Outlook\nOne such titan is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been at the forefront of the tech-dominated rally that has helped the benchmark S&P 500 index gain 15% this year. Apple's shares are not only up more than 50% themselves, but they're also printing fresh all-time highs on a daily basis right now. But with the stock's RSI showing a score of 70, indicating overbought conditions, could Apple be the next big name to receive a cooling down order?\nRest assured, we at MarketBeat think this is unlikely. Yes, Apple has had its strongest first half of a year in over a decade, but if anything, this confirms just how strong a candidate is for a long-term buy and hold. Unlike, say, Google and Tesla, Apple's most recent earnings report strengthened the fundamental support behind the bull's case.\nThe numbers blew analyst expectations out of the water, their quarterly dividend was raised, and a fresh $90 billion buyback program was authorized. Revenue headwinds have been dissipating for Apple rather than appearing for the other two.\nMarketBeat's MarketRank Forecast tool still rates them as a Buy, as does the team over at Wedbush. Yesterday saw fresh optimism from analyst Dan Ives, who isn't afraid to call for a $4 trillion market cap even as Apple approaches the $3 trillion mark for the first time. Ives has been a long-term Apple bull and holds one of the most positive outlooks on Apple stock and its market potential.\nWhile many tech companies are starting to lag, Apple is gaining serious momentum. He likened their moves to playing chess while others were only playing checkers and predicted Apple's annual services revenue will reach nearly $100 billion this year. His price target of $220 will offend no one either, and even the all-time high printed on Wednesday suggests there's still a 15% upside to be had for investors getting involved.\nGetting Involved\nIt's not hard to buy into this optimism, either. Consider for a moment the growing belief that Wall Street has yet to fully grasp the potential for iPhone upgrades and their effect on Apple's revenue. It's predicted that the forthcoming release of the iPhone 15 could initiate a \"mini super cycle.\" It's an interesting call and is based on the fact that a significant proportion, approximately 25%, of iPhone users have chosen not to upgrade their devices over the past four years, so exploiting this untapped market presents a considerable revenue opportunity.\nIn addition, Apple's ecosystem has perhaps never been more robust, with CEO Tim Cook recently unveiling their new Vision Pro headset. This has been well received and is seen as a crucial step towards Apple establishing a comprehensive app ecosystem driven by artificial intelligence.\nAnd best of all? The technicals are just as strong as the fundamentals. Apple's multi-month run of higher highs and higher lows with minimal pullbacks suggests none of the big players are taking profits, and having recently surpassed the previous all-time high from 2021, that's now become a solid line of support. There's nothing wrong with being cautious with stocks that have just had big runs, but we could still be at the starting line with Apple.\nOriginal Post\n\nApple's Bull Run Is Different From Other Tech Giants\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,919.00\n+84.8\n+0.18%\n\nUS 500 \n6,588.40\n+4.1\n+0.06%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.20\n+0.44\n+2.98%\n\nDollar Index \n97.14\n-0.006\n-0.01%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.85\n+0.16\n+0.26%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.15\n+0.16\n+0.24%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.956\n+0.015\n+0.51%\n\nGold Futures\n3,680.12\n-6.28\n-0.17%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.65\n-0.180\n-0.42%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6518\n-0.0002\n0.00%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.63\n-5.38\n-0.51%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.064\n+0.005\n+0.12%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.04\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.25\n-0.03\n-0.03%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.79\n-0.09\n-0.07%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

Markets\n\nPublished06/29/2023, 09:00 AM\n\nGoogle Was Just Downgraded, but This Could Be a Good Thing\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nMarketBeat.com\nArticles(5360)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nGOOG\n0.25%\n\nUBS and Bernstein downgraded Google shares to a Neutral equivalent this week.\nAfter a 50% run since November, they think the stock is in for a breather.\nHowever, both remain bullish on the long-term potential, which is good for us.\nAfter watching their shares rally by more than 50% from last November, it must have been a kick in the teeth for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), better known as Google, to receive two downgrades this week. But that's exactly what came from the teams over at UBS and Bernstein. Not all hope is lost for this rally, however. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts said and see why this could end up being a good thing for Google shares.\nThe first downgrade came from UBS on Monday, with the team there focusing on the aforementioned rally but viewing it almost as a negative. In the context of further room for it to run, they expressed concerns about its growth potential as well as some near-term challenges in making money.\nAnalyst Lloyd Walmsley and his team adjusted their rating on Google shares from Buy to Neutral. He explained that he finds it hard to see big revenue growth for Google Sites, expecting it to be in the single-digit range. Walmsley also mentioned a potential risk to revenue in the medium term as new search features replace ad space with generative AI responses.\nAI Concerns\nIn a note to investors, Walmsley noted that although worries about the cost of generative AI have eased, investors still have some short-term risks to consider. He highlighted that Google raised its spending plans in the last quarter and emphasized a preference for quicker-depreciating technical infrastructure. While Walmsley now sees the cost and competition as less severe, he still feels that some risk remains.\nThen shortly after the bell rang to start yesterday's session, Google faced its second downgrade, this time from investment firm Bernstein. The team there echoed the concerns of UBS, saying the downgrade was primarily driven by the tech giant's 40% surge in stock value since November last year.\nMark Shmulik and his team revised their rating on Google shares from Outperform down to Market Perform, the equivalent of UBS' Buy to Neutral move. Shmulik raised similar concerns about Google's ambitious integration of generative AI into core search results, which could potentially result in a decline in search ad pricing, albeit a short-term one.\nConsidering A Position\nThat the advent of AI is considered to be a headwind to the stock will be a frustrating pill for Google investors to swallow. This will especially be the case given they get to watch the shares of tech peers like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reap the reward, and understandably, Google shares sold off through both Monday and Tuesday's sessions. However, we here at MarketBeat see this as a good thing, with a potentially solid entry point opening up.\nNeither Shmulik nor Walmsley was bearish enough to downgrade Google shares to a full Sell rating, nor were they overly bearish on the stock's longer-term potential. In many ways, they're calling for some sideways action and for the stock to consolidate after the ripping run it's had, which mightn't be a bad thing for those of us thinking about getting involved.\nThere are few things more frustrating for an investor than chasing a stock higher with entries that never get filled. So if Google stock is going to trade sideways for a while, it gives us the opportunity to properly gauge where new support and resistance lines may be and work entries around there with more confidence of them being filled.\nAnd the cherry on top? Even though they downgraded the stock, UBS still raised their price target on Google shares from $123 to $132. Sure, it came with the caveat that the risk-reward balance is more even now rather than being strongly in favor of significant gains, but it still points to a further upside of more than 10%. If that's to be expected from a stock that's set to take a breather, then any further weakness from these downgrades truly will become a great entry point for the long term.\nOriginal Post\n\nGoogle Was Just Downgraded, but This Could Be a Good Thing\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,919.00\n+84.8\n+0.18%\n\nUS 500 \n6,588.40\n+4.1\n+0.06%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.20\n+0.44\n+2.98%\n\nDollar Index \n97.14\n-0.006\n-0.01%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.85\n+0.16\n+0.26%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.15\n+0.16\n+0.24%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.956\n+0.015\n+0.51%\n\nGold Futures\n3,680.12\n-6.28\n-0.17%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.65\n-0.180\n-0.42%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6518\n-0.0002\n0.00%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.63\n-5.38\n-0.51%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.064\n+0.005\n+0.12%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.04\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.25\n-0.03\n-0.03%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.79\n-0.09\n-0.07%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
