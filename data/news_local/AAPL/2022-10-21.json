In difficult economic times, many investors favor blue chip companies. They hope blue chip stocks will generate investment gains with more stable prices and dividend payments, avoiding the volatility of smaller and more speculative stocks.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nEven in the world of blue chip companies, there are a lot of stocks that span all sectors of the economy. It can be difficult to decide which stocks in this corner of the investment universe are the best bet. That’s where a blue chip stock ETF comes in.\nInvesting\nInvesting in blue chip stock ETFs\nAn exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that trades just like a stock. However, with each share purchased, an investor gets instant diversification through the portfolio of stocks contained within the fund. A blue chip stock ETF can give a portfolio exposure to dozens or even hundreds of different companies across the whole economic spectrum.\n\nThere are lots of different blue chip ETFs to choose from. Here is a list of some of the top offerings in 2025:\nData source: iShares, Vanguard, State Street SPDR, and Invesco.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\nThe first step in choosing an ETF is deciding what you need your portfolio to accomplish. For many investors, that starts with getting growth and income from broad-based stock market exposure. That’s where the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 0.03%) comes in, which is one of the most recognizable funds around.\n\nAs its name implies, the ETF mirrors the performance of the S&P 500 index -- one of the three most-cited indexes of stock market performance that tracks approximately 500 of the largest U.S. companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange. This also happens to be the largest ETF, with $661.5 billion in investor assets under management. The expense ratio is just 0.0945% annually (or $0.94 per year for every $1,000 invested).\n\n2. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, often simply referred to as “the Dow,” is another top-watched index in the U.S. for measuring the performance of stocks. The index is made up of 30 U.S. blue chip company stocks that act as a gauge of the U.S. stock market health overall, although most professional investors focus on indexes such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite to judge market conditions.\n\nNevertheless, if an investment in the curated 30-stock portfolio of the Dow is what you’re after, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NASDAQ:DIA) is a solid blue chip investment. The fund charges 0.16% a year. It provides exposure to every sector of the U.S. economy, although the Dow index is heavily skewed toward healthcare, tech, and financial services.\n3. Invesco QQQ Trust\n\nThe third widely watched and cited U.S. stock index is the Nasdaq Composite index, which consists of all the company stocks exclusively listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Although it has become more diverse over the years, the Nasdaq is heavy on technology.\n\nFor a blue chip stock twist on the Nasdaq, though, consider the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.51%). The ETF is one of the largest and most-traded funds, focusing on the largest approximately 100 nonfinancial company stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. The annual fee is 0.2%. Top holdings in the ETF are iconic tech brandsApple (AAPL 1.82%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.82%), Amazon (AMZN -0.74%), Tesla (TSLA 7.21%), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.22%) (GOOG 0.27%).\n4. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF\n\nOne of the top reasons to be invested in blue chip stocks is for the dividends -- excess cash that a company pays to its shareholders. Even better than a dividend, though, is a dividend that increases over time. That’s where the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (VIG -0.37%) shines.\n\nThe ETF consists of 337 stocks with a track record of increasing their dividend payouts over time. A rising dividend is evidence of a company that can increase its profitability, which is the primary driver of stock price appreciation. A rising stock price and a rising dividend give investors two ways to compound their investment returns. This Vanguard ETF’s annual fee is just 0.05% a year.\nETFs 5 - 8\n5. iShares Core High Dividend ETF\n\nNot all dividend-paying stocks need to have proven their ability to rapidly raise their payout over time to make them a worthy investment. The iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV -0.62%) takes an alternate approach to income-generating blue chip stocks. It invests in 75 large companies in good financial health, paying a relatively high dividend yield.\n\nThe fund charges 0.08% a year in fees. Its focus is on sectors of the economy with stocks that tend to pay higher dividend yields, such as energy and utilities, healthcare, and consumer goods companies. Top holdings include energy giants ExxonMobil (XOM 0.06%) and Chevron (CVX -0.64%), and pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.23%).\n6. Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF\n\nNot every blue chip stock needs to be a big dividend payer. Even large companies can still put up above-average sales growth rates. If blue chip company growth is what you’re looking for, then the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (VUG 0.41%) is a top-notch option.\n\nThe fund invests in 165 U.S. companies that are still growing rapidly. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.04% a year and manages $324.3 billion in customer funds. Investing in growing companies comes with trade-offs, though. More than half of the fund’s assets are allocated to technology stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others). While these businesses have better odds of expanding over time, their stock prices tend to fluctuate in value much more than the overall market. This makes it one of the more volatile blue chip ETFs on this list.\n\n7. iShares MSCI EAFE ETF\n\nLarge, well-established, and easily recognizable businesses don’t just come from the U.S. The whole world is filled with top brands, and it’s also possible to invest in them. iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA -0.4%) aims to help with just that. The fund is composed of more than 697 large company stocks located outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe ETF charges 0.32% a year in fees. Top holdings include food conglomerate Nestle (NSRGY -0.94%), healthcare products and big pharma company Roche (RHHBY -1.71%), and top semiconductor supplier ASML Holding (ASML 1.31%).\n8. iShares Global 100 ETF\n\nThe iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO 0.06%) is another international blue chip company fund. It includes stocks from North America and holds 100 of the world's largest businesses. The ETF's expense ratio is a modest 0.4%.\n\nThe fund offers investors a global blend of all the companies previously mentioned above -- from tech titans to large healthcare companies to financial service providers. The businesses also run the gamut from fast-growing to more stable dividend payers. For a well-rounded portfolio of large-cap stocks, the iShares Global 100 ETF is worth a look.\nRelated investing topics\n\n \n Best Nasdaq ETFs\n \n \nThe Nasdaq has historically delivered a high return on investment.

it a trend? A sign of the times? Or both?\nWhat I am referring to are share buybacks.\nTalk on Wall Street this week included a whole lot of conversations about share buybacks. They are a great way to keep investors interested in times when earnings fail to meet expectations or past performances, and that is certainly what is happening now. Buybacks also serve to dominate the takeaways on earnings calls that make headlines. And in this bearish market, that is the sort of stuff that more and more companies seem to be reaching for.\nKicking off the chatter on buybacks this past week, of course, was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.\nMusk floated the idea of introducing a Tesla share buyback program valued between $5 billion and $10 billion during an earnings call following Tesla’s third-quarter report on Oct. 19, according to reports.\nThis mention did not come out of the blue. Tesla has not put in a stellar performance in the first half of the year, and its stock has dropped about 16% so far this month. It closed yesterday at $214.59, up 3.45% on the day.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nAnd given the reasons for Tesla’s lackluster performance – supply-chain delays and a weakening demand for new cars – the likelihood of this downward trajectory for its stock will continue. But a buyback program changes the dynamic somewhat, increasing shareholder value and keeping investors from abandoning ship.\nBut keep in mind: The one thing that Musk did not mention when he talked about buybacks was a timeline. All he said, according to media reports, was: “We debated the buyback idea extensively at board level. The board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. We want to work through the right process to do a buyback.”\nTesla reported a third-quarter net profit of $3.3 billion on revenues of $21.45 billion.\nSnap Shares Not Snapping Back\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) shareholders are another group that has been offered a buyback. But this is not the first time.\nThe social media company reported second-quarter earnings this week that failed to impress, nor met analysts’ expectations. Revenues came in at $1.11 billion, short of the $1.14 billion anticipated.\nThe board, as it did at the end of the second quarter, authorized a stock buyback program with a limit of $500 million. But will it do the trick?\nSince its last earnings report earlier this summer, the company’s shares have shed about 30% of their value.\nWe’ll see where the valuation goes from here.\nYesterday, Snap stock took a beating, losing another 28% on the day to close at $7.75. That’s rivalling the lowest point it hit back in 2019.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nTech Companies At Top Of Buyback Charts\nTech companies have been at the top of the leader boards when it comes to the size of buyback programs being offered in 2022, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) leading the pack, according to Verity data.\nApple offered a $21.7-billion buyback program in the second quarter of 2022, representing just under 1% of its outstanding shares. Alphabet issued a $15.8-billion offer, which set a company record. Meanwhile, Microsoft put forward a $7.8-billion package in Q2, which matched its offer in the previous quarter. Meta bought back $5.1 billion in the second quarter.\nWith many of the tech companies set to report in the coming week, we might see a clearer path for this trend. One last fun fact: tech companies represent about 25% of the overall market.\nLockheed Gets In On The Act\nBut, of course, buybacks are not just for tech companies.\nWhen Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced its earnings last week – which were quite spectacular – the company announced it would increase its buyback plan to $14 billion and expects to move on a $4-billion accelerated share repurchase program in the four quarter..\nLockheed shares jumped just over 8.5% on the earnings report at the beginning of the week and climbed steadily since, closing Friday at $454, a gain of about 14% on the week overall.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nTop Winners And Losers Of The Week\nAgain, for all those out there who are keeping score, here are the top gainers of the past week:\nOn the S&P 500\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX): +25.94%\nSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB): +19.52%\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG): +19.38%\nLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX): +17.32%\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT): +16.76%\nOn the NASDAQ Composite\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN): +62.67%\nAcorda Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ACOR): 53.59%\nAVEO Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AVEO): +47.31%\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR): +40.96%\nClean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE): +36.14%\nAnd the biggest losers:\nOn the S&P 500\nSVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB): -27.61%\nGenerac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC): -19.96%\nM&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB): -12.84%\nRobert Half International (NYSE:RHI): -9.88%\nComerica (NYSE:CMA): -9.39%\nOn the NASDAQ Composite\nNational CineMedia Inc (NASDAQ:NCMI): -30.81%\nSVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB): -27.61%\nAlpine Immune Sciences (NASDAQ:ALPN): -19.15%\nStabilis Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SLNG): -18.95%\nNeptune Wellness Solutions (NASDAQ:NEPT): -16.9%\n\nWhat Happened This Week: Poor Earnings Reports And Buybacks\n\nView all comments (7)7\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,917.00\n+82.8\n+0.18%\n\nUS 500 \n6,588.40\n+4.1\n+0.06%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.21\n+0.45\n+3.05%\n\nDollar Index \n97.152\n+0.006\n+0.01%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.86\n+0.17\n+0.27%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.12\n+0.13\n+0.19%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.958\n+0.017\n+0.58%\n\nGold Futures\n3,680.90\n-5.50\n-0.15%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.655\n-0.175\n-0.41%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6525\n+0.0005\n+0.01%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.38\n-5.63\n-0.54%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.687\n+0.008\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.628\n+0.003\n+0.08%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.04\n+0.009\n+0.22%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.23\n-0.05\n-0.04%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.78\n-0.10\n-0.08%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

slowest quarterly sales growth ever last night\nShares have tumbled nearly 85% this year, wiping out $88 billion from its market cap\nThe Snapchat app, however, is still very popular with young people—as numbers show\nEven with the bar set remarkably low, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) managed to produce yet another disappointing earnings report yesterday. The owner of the Snapchat app reported its slowest quarterly sales growth ever, blaming an environment where companies are driven to slash their advertising spending.\nThe California-based company said third-quarter sales increased 6% to $1.13 billion, slightly short of analysts’ average estimate of $1.14 billion. But the biggest disappointment is that the social media company is failing to find a direction even after spending the past quarter realigning its priorities to deal with a tough macro environment. \nAnd that’s not all. Snap added in its earnings statement last night:\n“[Revenue growth] continues to be impacted by a number of factors we have noted throughout the past year, including platform policy changes, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased competition.\nWe are finding that our advertising partners across many industries are decreasing their marketing budgets, especially in the face of operating environment headwinds, inflation-driven cost pressures, and rising costs of capital.”\nSnap’s earnings report is the first from big internet companies, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Analysts now believe that the miss could suggest that the worst may not yet be over for the sector that thrived during the pandemic.\nSnap stock was down as much as 30% at the time of writing to trade at $7.49 a share. Snap shares have tumbled nearly 85% this year, slashing the company’s market cap to just $12.37 billion from more than $100 billion a year ago. \n\nFierce Competition\nA plunge of this magnitude raised the question of whether this is a buying opportunity for growth-focused investors. After all, the Snapchat app is still very popular with young people for sending disappearing messages and augmenting videos with special effects. It ended the quarter with 363 million daily active users, up 57 million from a year earlier.\nDespite this massive subscriber base, Snap’s revenue outlook is becoming gloomier, suggesting that top-line growth will be hard to come by for at least a few years.\nThe average revenue per user fell 11% in the previous quarter to $3.11, missing the $3.19 average analyst projection.\nIn addition, users in the U.S., the company’s most lucrative market, are spending less time watching content on Snapchat, a clear sign that fierce competition from Chinese-owned TikTok has begun to hurt.\nFurthermore, new privacy settings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that require all social media companies to get smartphone users’ permission for tracking continue to make it more difficult for advertisers to measure and manage their ad campaigns on social platforms.\nHighlighting these challenges, Bernstein analysts downgraded the social media stock to market perform from outperform, saying Snap has lost its growth momentum. In a note to clients, the equity research firm said:\n“With a stock down -85% over the past 12 months, suggesting that investor expectations were low going into earnings is an understatement. Yet low expectations offered no support for a company that seems to have lost all momentum.”\nMorgan Stanley, which is underweight on the company, said in a post-earnings note that Snap stock represents “a high execution risk with management/strategic change” against a more challenging economic backdrop.\nBottom Line\nDespite the massive beating in the current market downturn, Snap is still far from offering an effective growth plan for long-term investors. Furthermore, the company will likely continue to face budget cuts from advertisers, and there is little visibility of when that environment will improve. \nYou’re better off not trying to catch this falling knife.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author doesn’t own any shares mentioned in this report.
