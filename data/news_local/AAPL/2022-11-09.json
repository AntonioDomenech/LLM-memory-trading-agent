Markets\n\nPublished11/09/2022, 12:52 PM\n\nCan Meta‚Äôs Cost-Cutting Measures Save Its Sinking Stock?\n\nView all comments (7)7\n\nHaris Anwar\nArticles(1312)\n\nFollow\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nMeta‚Äôs massive job cuts mark a major turning point for the social media giant after a tumultuous year\nThe biggest uncertainty hurting Meta's stock is Zuckerberg's pivot to the metaverse\nThis year's sharp decline has made Meta‚Äôs fundamentals more attractive than many value stocks\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is in deep restructuring mode. Earlier today, the parent of Facebook and Instagram announced plans to cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce, in the first major drive of layoffs in the company‚Äôs 18-year history.\nWhile reductions will happen across the company, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company‚Äôs recruiting and business teams would be disproportionately affected. Meta will also reduce its real estate footprint and review its infrastructure spending, with more cost-cutting announcements expected in the coming months.\nJob cuts of this scale mark a significant turning point for the social media giant, which, until last year, was on a solid growth path, crushing earnings expectations and producing margins that Wall Street executives envied.\nBut a year later, it looks more like a survival story. The Menlo Park, California-based company has lost about $800 billion in market cap as its stock plunged about 70% since its September peak, making Meta the worst-performing large-cap technology company.\n\nSome factors that helped bring the social media giant to its knees aren‚Äôt unique to the company. For example, the digital ad market is shrinking as companies take measures to hedge recession risks. In addition, it has become extremely difficult for social media companies to target users with the right ads after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) changed its privacy settings by allowing users to stop ad targeting. \nFierce Competition\nFurthermore, increasing competition from the Chinese-owned TikTok is eroding Facebook and Instagram appeal among youngsters, creating an existential threat that requires massive investments and the right set of products to succeed.\nHowever, the most significant setback is certainly Zuckerberg‚Äôs pivot to the metaverse, a virtual-reality-fueled world that he thinks will host the future of work and communication. Not only are investors increasingly doubtful of the enterprise‚Äôs success, but they are also questioning its timing. \nZuckerberg committed billions of dollars at a time when Facebook‚Äôs cash machine was slowing, and the competition was heating up. In today‚Äôs announcement, Zuckerberg appears to have recognized this mistake. He told employees in a letter:\n‚ÄúAt the start of COVID, the world rapidly moved online, and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.‚Äù \nThe effort is costing Meta billions, and the company expects to lose more money on the metaverse bet next year. According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, the company‚Äôs transition to the metaverse is grappling with glitchy technology, uninterested users, and a lack of clarity about what it will take to succeed.\nAll the negative factors are very much reflected in Meta‚Äôs stock price today. The sharp decline in its stock value has made Meta‚Äôs valuation cheaper than many value stocks when considering price relative to profits. The Menlo Park, California-based company now sells for nine times estimated earnings. By comparison, the average valuation in the NASDAQ 100 Index is around 23 times earnings. \nHowever, for some analysts, as evident from Investing.com‚Äôs poll, the current setup is a signal to dive in and scoop up Meta shares. \n\nSource: Investing.com\nThe bullish case is that the communications services behemoth‚Äîwhich not only owns Facebook, the largest social media platform in the world but is also the parent company of Instagram and WhatsApp, among other properties‚Äîhas produced massive profits for many years and, thus, things could change quickly should the macroeconomic situations improve.\nWith that, investors have to trust that Zuckerberg‚Äôs pivot to the metaverse is worth letting other growth opportunities go. That‚Äôs perhaps the most difficult part of the puzzle that Meta has become these days.\nBottom Line\nMeta stock could reverse its course in the short run following the company‚Äôs cost-cutting measures. But I don‚Äôt see that rally going too far. The company‚Äôs $69 billion Capex spendings in the next two years remain a major drag on the stock‚Äôs powerful rebound from these low levels. Meta is a stock for high-risk-takers who want to gamble on the next big thing that could take years to pay off.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author is long on Apple stock.
