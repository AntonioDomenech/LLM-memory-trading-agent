US stock markets increasingly look to be rolling over into a new bear on extreme Fed tightening. How the leaders are faring will help determine whether that fearsome beast is really awakening from a long hibernation. The just-finishing Q1’22 earnings season reveals how the largest US companies are doing.\nThe mighty S&P 500 (SPX) is the flagship benchmark US stock index. Not only is it closely watched by nearly all traders, but its large component stocks are also heavily owned by most investors. The huge SPDR® S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV), and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) exchange-traded funds are the biggest in the world by far, with staggering assets this week of $385.7b, $304.4b, and $258.2b!\nThe SPX enjoyed a blowout 2021, powering up to new all-time closing highs on fully 27% of all last year’s trading days! But after one final record close at 4,797 on this year’s opening trading day, 2022 is looking way different. Just a couple days later, heavy selling ignited on the mid-December Federal Open Market Committee meeting’s minutes. There top Fed officials had started discussing quantitative-tightening bond selling.\nQT is a serious threat to stock markets levitated for years by extreme Fed money printing via quantitative easing. By mid-April that had mushroomed to an absurd $4,806.9b in just 25.5 months! The Fed’s balance sheet had skyrocketed 115.6% since March 2020’s pandemic-lockdown stock panic, effectively more than doubling the US money supply! The SPX’s 114.4% gain at best in that span mirrored monetary growth.\nThe last time the Fed attempted QT and rate hikes in 2018, the SPX plummeted 19.8% in 3.1 months into late December! That near-bear approach frightened top Fed officials into caving, prematurely killing both QT bond selling and rate hikes. But traders haven’t forgotten that severe market thrashing, which is why the SPX has been carving lower highs and lower lows this year as extreme-Fed-tightening jawboning mounted.\nAt worst in late April, the long-impervious S&P 500 had already crumbled 13.9% in just 3.8 months! This is already the worst selloff since March 2020’s stock panic, dropping ever closer to the -20% formal new-bear threshold. Recent months’ price action sure looks bear-like, a distinct downtrend well-defined by both declining upper-resistance and lower-support lines. Downlegs are followed by fierce short-covering rallies.\nWith a young bear probably underway but not yet confirmed, the big US stocks’ latest quarterly results are exceedingly-important. If these universally-held stalwart market generals have already been pounded to fundamentally-cheap levels, odds are higher a bear market can be averted. But if they remain expensive from that epic deluge of QE4 money printing, much-greater downside from a severe bear mauling is likely.\nFor 19 quarters in a row now, I’ve analyzed how the 25-largest US companies dominating the SPX fared in their latest earnings season. As the just-reported Q1’22 ended, these behemoths alone accounted for a heavily-concentrated 43.6% of the entire S&P 500’s weighting! The highest on record since I started this deep-research thread, the stock-market outlook is mostly-dependent on the big US stocks’ fortunes.\nUS companies have 40 days after quarter-ends to file comprehensive 10-Q quarterly reports with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. As of the middle of this week, 34 days had passed since that last quarter wound down. While the SPX plunged as much as 13.0% within Q1, a sharp bear-market-rally-like surge left if down just 4.9% in Q1 proper. This table below shows some key highlights from that quarter’s 10-Qs.\nEach big US company’s stock symbol is preceded by its ranking change within the S&P 500 over the past year since the end of Q1’21. These symbols are followed by their stocks’ Q1’22 quarter-end weightings in the SPX, along with their enormous market capitalizations then. Market caps’ year-over-year changes are shown, revealing how those stocks performed for investors independent of manipulative stock buybacks.\nThose have been off-the-charts in recent years, fueled by the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy and trillions of dollars of bond monetizations. Stock buybacks are deceptive financial engineering undertaken to artificially boost stock prices and earnings per share, which maximizes executives’ huge compensation. Looking at market-cap changes rather than stock-price ones neutralizes some of stock buybacks’ distorting effects.\nNext comes each of these big US stocks’ quarterly revenues, hard earnings under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, stock buybacks, trailing-twelve-month price-to-earnings ratios, dividends paid, and operating cash flows generated in Q1’22 followed by their year-over-year changes. Fields are left blank if companies hadn’t reported that particular data as of mid-week, or if it doesn’t exist like negative P/E ratios.\nPercentage changes are excluded if they aren’t meaningful, primarily when data shifted from positive to negative or vice-versa. These latest quarterly results are very important for American stock investors, including anyone with retirement accounts, to understand. They illuminate whether these lofty US stock markets are fundamentally-sound in the face of very-bearish aggressive Fed rate hikes and QT bond selling.\n\nThese 25-largest US stocks dominating the American stock markets are all fantastic companies with great businesses. There’s no other way they could grow so massive. But being awesome doesn’t mean their underlying fundamentals justify their stock prices. Valuations are ignored in late-stage bulls as euphoric momentum-chasing buying reigns. But how expensive stocks are fuels bears, driving their sizes and durations.\nAgain commanding a staggering 43.6% of the SPX’s entire market cap as Q1’22 wound down, these elite stocks effectively are the US markets! The concentration risk is even worse than that indicates, since the top-5 beloved mega-cap tech stocks alone account for 24.0% of the SPX! Exiting last quarter they were mostly-usual market-darling suspects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Meta dropped to 8th!\nWhile that former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been crushed this year, it still has far more in common with the top-4 US stocks than that leading electric-car manufacturer. For years I’ve broken out the top 5 separately, which long included AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, and FB. I’m going to keep that traditional mega-cap-tech grouping today, even though Meta has fallen from grace. So FB is still considered top-5 and TSLA bottom-20.\nThe collective market caps of these 25-largest US stocks blasted 24.0% higher year-over-year between the ends of Q1’21 to Q1’22 to $18,046.6b! That trounced the overall SPX, which saw much-more-modest 14.0% gains. That reflects institutional investors increasingly crowding into the biggest US companies, simply because their stocks have enjoyed the best returns. That spawns virtuous circles of huge capital inflows.\nOverall revenues at the SPX top 25 last quarter soared a phenomenal 13.1% YoY to $1,041.4b! That’s amazing growth at the vast scales these giants operate at, and a major new all-time-record high. But with inflation raging thanks to the Fed’s extreme QE4 money printing, bigger sales dollars also reflect surging general-price levels. The latest Consumer Price Index inflation print in March rocketed up a scary 8.5% YoY!\nFor years big US stocks’ overall revenue growth was disproportionally won by those top-5 mega-cap techs. But interestingly that wasn’t the case in Q1, despite them enjoying excellent 11.7%-YoY sales increases to $359.0b. Surprisingly the next-20-largest SPX stocks bettered that, reporting sales climbing a larger 13.9% YoY to $682.4b! Inflation or not, that implies the largest American companies are faring great.\nUnfortunately that is misleading, resulting from major composition changes among the SPX top 25 rather than actual results. Normally the rankings among these elite companies don’t change much, but this past year has been an extraordinary exception. Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) all charged up by double-digit rankings changes to achieve biggest-US-company status! That is incredibly-unusual.\nSince the S&P 500 is weighted by components’ market capitalizations, that means these newer stocks enjoyed bigger rallies over this past year displacing struggling ones. A couple high-profile examples are PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which plummeted from 19th and 25th in the comparable Q1’21 to 61st and 49th in this recently-finished Q1’22! These market-darlings’ smaller sales and profits never justified huge market caps.\nLast quarter, this pair of falling-from-favor companies merely reported collective revenues and earnings of $14.4b and $2.1b. Meanwhile the two companies that replaced them in the SPX top 25 dwarfed that, with an enormous $80.0b and $14.1b in Q1 sales and profits! Oil super-major Chevron accounted for most of that, with revenues and earnings skyrocketing 75.0% and 354.5% YoY on much-higher crude-oil prices.\nIn US terms quarterly-average oil prices soared 63.4% YoY to $94.98, resulting in a huge windfall for the big oil companies! Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) also contributed to surging SPX-top-25 sales with massive 48.3%-YoY growth. After Chevron the next-largest new company in these elite ranks is Pfizer. Selling those mRNA COVID-19 injections has been gangbusters business, as PFE’s sales and profits soared 76.0% and 61.2% YoY!\nSo had Chevron and Pfizer alone not replaced PayPal and Netflix, overall SPX-top-25 revenues would have been $65.7b lower in Q1’22. The big US stocks’ sales aren’t as great as they look, much of their big growth is composition changes. Naturally the same is true on the hard-earnings front under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Overall SPX-top-25 accounting profits actually slumped 2.4% YoY to $146.8b!\nOminously that’s the first time aggregate profits of the biggest US companies fell since Q2’20, which was the dark heart of pandemic lockdowns. Lower profits absolutely are even more stunning considering all this red-hot inflation driving up price levels. Shockingly all those declines came from those elite top-5 mega-cap techs, which saw earnings implode 17.2% YoY to $61.8b! Even their fantastic businesses are flagging.\nNot Apple and Microsoft, which still enjoyed good 5.8% and 8.2%-YoY profits growth. But earnings fell 8.3% and 21.4% YoY at Alphabet and Meta, while Amazon’s plummeted from an $8.1b profit in Q1’21 to a $3.8b loss in Q1’22! Long considered fortress stocks immune from worries, AMZN stock crashed a brutal 14.0% the day after it reported Q1 results! Q2 sales guidance was 5.2% below Wall Street estimates.\nThe next-20-largest SPX stocks including Tesla saw earnings soar 12.2% YoY last quarter to $85.0b! Elon Musk’s cult-favorite electric-car maker contributed, with profits skyrocketing 615.1% YoY to $3.3b. But those far-higher corporate earnings were overwhelmingly driven by composition changes, with just CVX and PFE reporting $12.0b more in Q1 profits than the knocked-out-of-these-rankings PYPL and NFLX.\nHad those displacements alone not happened, overall SPX-top-25 earnings would’ve fallen 10.4% YoY. Raging inflation is very corrosive to corporate profits. Companies can’t pass along all their higher input costs to customers, as raising selling prices big-and-fast would drive away plenty. But even modest price hikes erode sales as some customers look for substitutes, or choose to do without. Weaker earnings are likely.\nBut big US companies’ managements aren’t battening down the hatches preparing for the Fed’s inflation tsunami to slow their businesses considerably. Instead they continued buying back their stocks like there is no tomorrow, maximizing their personal compensation. Total stock buybacks across these SPX-top-25 companies in Q1’22 soared a mind-boggling 35.1% YoY to $95.0b! Those mega-cap techs accounted for 6/10ths!\nPouring shareholders’ cash at these vast levels into manipulating stock prices higher isn’t sustainable. Mighty Apple has built the biggest business the world has ever seen around ubiquitous pocket computers. But even it can’t afford the $22.6b and $3.6b it plowed into stock buybacks and dividends last quarter. Together those added up to 104.9% of quarterly earnings. Meta’s buybacks were 127.3% of its Q1’22 profits!\nIt wasn’t just the mega-cap techs spending more on stock buybacks and dividends than their businesses generated in GAAP-profits terms. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Eli Lilly, and Broadcom spent 110.7%, 183.6%, 125.4%, and 187.2% of their quarterly profits on “returning cash to shareholders”! Dividends actually do that, but stock buybacks are ultimately wasteful and manipulative. They aren’t a productive use of scarce capital.\nOur quarterly-earnings spreadsheet includes much more data than I can fit into these tables, including the cash positions of these big US stocks. Their overall cash treasuries plunged 14.5% YoY to $745.9b in Q1’22, with similar declines among both the top-5 and next-20 largest! With inflation cutting into profits, these elite US companies can’t afford to burn big cash for long to fund outsized stock buybacks and pay dividends.\nSince cash dividends are so important to investors, companies will slash their much-larger repurchases long before quarterly direct payments. Total dividends among these SPX-top-25 companies grew a way-slower 12.6% YoY to a much-smaller $38.1b. Overall stock buybacks dwarfed that, again up 35.1% YoY to $95.0b. So buying back their own stocks will come to the chopping block as corporate profits and cash wane.\nThe Fed’s new accelerated rate-hike cycle will also have a serious dampening effect on recent years’ stock-buyback mania. Since many elite companies were plowing more money into manipulating stock prices than their earnings could support, they borrowed money for buybacks. But with the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy dead and borrowing costs surging, debt-financing repurchases will get way-more expensive.\nOminously the single-largest source of overall stock demand for years now has been stock buybacks! So if companies are forced to pare those back due to inflation eroding profits and higher interest rates, that is very-bearish for US stock markets. Lower buybacks going forward greatly increase ..."}, {"title": "UK Plans Increased Big Tech Oversight, But Is Vague On When (Or If) Enforcement Begins", "source": {"name": "Benzinga", "homepage_url": "https://www.benzinga.com/", "logo_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg", "favicon_url": "https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"}, "url": "https://www.benzinga.com/government/22/05/27049686/uk-plans-increased-big-tech-oversight-but-is-vague-on-when-or-if-enforcement-begins", "content": "The U.K. government is planning to launch a new regulatory agency that oversees major tech companies, but the launch and dimensions of this agency remain unclear.\nWhat Happened: The BBC reported that the new Digital Markets Unit (DMU) would have the authority to address \"predatory practices\" of tech leaders such as Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc.
