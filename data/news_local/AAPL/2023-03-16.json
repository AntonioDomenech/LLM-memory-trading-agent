Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.\n\nIf you’re looking for hot growth stocks, initial public offerings (IPOs) are a great place to start your search. These freshly minted public companies tend to make a splash in the market with big growth expectations and high price tags to match. Although not every IPO stock will be a winner, some of the most valuable companies in the world, such as Amazon (AMZN -0.74%) and Apple (AAPL 1.82%), were once initial public offerings and have turned early investors into millionaires.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDefinition\nWhat is an IPO Stock?\nAn IPO stock is a stock that has recently gone public. That means it has gone through the process of selling its shares to a group of investors, typically with help of an underwriter, and then listing the stock with an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, where investors can easily buy and sell it.\nA company can sell more shares to the public in what's typically known as a follow-on offering, or a secondary offering. There is an important distinction between the two, though they are sometimes used interchangeably.\nFollow-on offering: A follow-on offering refers to a company selling its stock after its IPO. Companies are free to do this at any time, though they must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and it means that existing shareholders will be diluted. This can be called a primary offering.\nSecondary offering: A secondary offering refers to a block of stock being sold by an existing shareholder, not the company. This also typically requires public notification through an SEC filing. The main difference between a secondary and a primary offering is that a secondary offering doesn't dilute existing shareholders, though it also doesn't raise any money for the company.\nRecent IPOs\nRecent IPOs\nAfter a boom in IPOs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the market went ice-cold in 2022 as tech stocks plunged and interest rates soared. However, as the Nasdaq Composite has bounced back, the IPO market has shown signs of life once again, with several new issues debuting over the last year.\n1. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave (CRWV -0.67%), a generative-AI focused cloud infrastructure business, had a disappointing IPO, but the stock has surged since then, gaining more than 300% from its IPO price of $40 at one point.\n\nCoreWeave's IPO came at the end of March 2025, when concern about tariffs, weakening consumer sentiment, and a potential slowdown in AI spending weighed on the market. The IPO was undersubscribed, and the offering was priced below its target range. Nvidia (NVDA 0.43%), a major customer, bought into the offering, helping to make it happen.\nAs confidence in the economy has returned, CoreWeave stock has soared. The company is delivering skyrocketing growth with revenue up 420% in the first quarter, showing soaring demand for the AI computing power that it offers. However, CoreWeave is still deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis and has high customer concentration, making it risky. Its business model also requires heavy spending on capital expenditures, buying GPUs that it essentially rents out as computing power to customers, meaning it has considerable debt and high interest expenses.\nIt's a risky stock, but its growth rate shows that it has huge potential. It's also a rare pure-play AI stock.\n2. ServiceTitan\nAnother recent IPO that has attracted some attention is ServiceTitan (TTAN -3.15%), a cloud-based software platform designed to help trade businesses like plumbing, HVAC, and electrical services.\nSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks have had a lot of success over the last decade, and ServiceTitan is the leader in its software niche. It's delivering solid growth.\n\nDuring the 12 months ended July 31, 2024, revenue rose 24% to $685 million on $62 billion in gross transaction volume.\nLike a lot of other software stocks, it's still unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. ServiceTitan was one of the largest IPOs of 2024, with a market cap that briefly topped $10 billion after its December 2024 IPO.\n3. Circle\nCircle Internet Group (CRCL -6.59%) just went public with a blazing-hot IPO. After pricing its offering at $31, the stock opened at $69 on its first trading day, and jumped 56% over the next two days.\nThe demand for Circle's shares indicates strong interest in crypto stocks. There are only a few pure-play crypto stocks on the market, and crypto has had a good year, largely avoiding the volatility that's hit the stock market during the trade war.\nCircle issues the stablecoin USDC, the biggest dollar-denominated stablecoin after Tether (USDT -0.03%). It earns money on transaction fees and interest on the reserves it holds to back the stablecoin. It also recently launched Circle Payments Network, which can facilitate cross-border payments in real time.\nCircle is profitable, with $155.7 million in net income in 2024 on $1.7 billion in revenue, up 13% from 2023.\n4. Omada Health\nAnother brand-new IPO is Omada Health (OMDA -0.72%), a virtual care company known for its focus on chronic conditions like diabetes.\nOmada went public on June 6, 2025, raising $150 million. The stock popped on its opening day, gaining 21% from its $19 IPO price.\nCombined with the response to the Circle IPO, investor sentiment seems to indicate strong demand for new issues after a long cold spell in IPOs.\nOmada's revenue rose 38% to $169.9 million in 2024 and reported a net loss of 47.1 million, which was an improvement from a loss of $67.5 million in 2023.\n5. Nebius Group\nNebius Group (NBIS 1.24%), a competitor to CoreWeave, went public last October before its larger rival did.\nNebius is also putting up blistering growth. Its revenue is up 385% in the first quarter to $55.3 million, but the company is rapidly losing money like CoreWeave.\nNebius is much smaller than CoreWeave, which topped $1 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, and its business model is slightly different. Nebius has a broader focus with services like managed databases and Machine Learning Ops services, while CoreWeave focuses primarily on access to AI computing power through Nvidia GPUs. However, both companies have tremendous growth potential.\n\nIPOs to watch\nIPO stocks to watch in 2025\n1. Stripe\nAs the most valuable privately held tech startup in the U.S., digital payments company Stripe may be the most anticipated IPO out there. While the company has not announced plans to go public, Reuters reported that Stripe had taken its first step toward a market debut, tapping a law firm to guide it through the process. The wire service also said the company was planning on a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO since it doesn't need to raise new funds.\nStripe, which provides cloud software that allows businesses to seamlessly process payments, took a valuation cut from $95 billion to $50 billion due to the crash in tech stocks. It was valued at $91.5 billion in a secondary offering in February 2025 that allowed employees to cash out their stock. Still, management continues to say that it aims to go public eventually, though it seems to keep putting off that decision.\n\n2. Shein\nShein could be the biggest IPO of 2025. The Chinese discount e-commerce site known for cheap clothes and similar merchandise filed confidentially to go public in November 2023.\nIn January 2025, Reuters reported that it was aiming for an IPO by midyear. While it hasn't revealed its financials yet, the company could reportedly be valued at $90 billion. Temu, a similar Chinese discount e-commerce site, has also grown rapidly, showing strong demand for cheap online merchandise and alternatives to Amazon.\nRegulatory scrutiny around its supply chain and labor practices seems to have derailed its hopes for an IPO in the U.S. for now, and the company is now looking to go public in Hong Kong.\n3. Discord\nAs of March 2025, media reports indicated that Discord, the messaging app that's popular with gamers, has been in early talks with bankers to go public as soon as 2025. Discord was valued at $15 billion in its last funding round in 2021.\nThe company has not confirmed any plans to go public. It now has more than 200 million monthly active users, with the vast majority of them using the app to play games. It makes money through a \"freemium\" business model, offering enhanced features for paying users.\nRelated investing topics\n\n \n Top Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025\n \n \nGet a list of the best companies to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\n \n Investing in Entertainment Stocks\n \n \nEntertaining people across media platforms is what these top companies do.\n\n \n Investing in Media Stocks\n \n \nThese companies distribute media to the masses.\n\n \n How to Calculate Total Stock Returns\n \n \nTotal returns can help compare the performance of investments that pay different dividend yields.\n\nHow to buy IPO stock\nHow to buy IPO stock\nMost of the big discount brokers -- Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW -0.43%), and E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, for example -- offer access to at least some IPOs. Each imposes different requirements for participation, but you must have an account with a broker to invest in an IPO via that broker. Here's how the process works:\n1. Prove eligibility\nBrokerages generally have some restrictions on who can invest in IPOs.
