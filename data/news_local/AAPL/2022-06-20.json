And in an Apple Research report titled \"Volumetric Hyper Reality, A Computer Graphics Holy Grail for the 21st Century?,\" it's evident that the company has explored hyper-reality and environmental feedback displays as far back as 1995.\nSee Also: Apple Stock Forecast\nToday, Apple boasts a massive augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) research unit with hundreds of employees. The company has also acquired tons of companies over the years in an effort to become a major player in the AR/VR space. \nAs a result, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant is now on the verge of debuting at least two separate product lines that could shake up this segment. The first device will be a VR visor with AR features expected to launch as soon as 2023. It was delayed from 2022, but is currently in the final stages of development and was already demonstrated to the company's board of directors.\nSee Also: Benzinga's primer on VR, AR, MR and XR\nThis device is also forecasted to be a niche mixed-reality (MR) headset focused on the VR aspects. At a glance, it will be much like Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ: FB) Oculus Quest line — capable of standalone operation with battery and onboard processing. It will feature Apple silicon on par with Mac devices, a sleek design and two 8K high-resolution micro OLED displays with a resolution of up to 3,000 pixels per inch.
