Host Brad Smith to break down what investors should consider when positioning their portfolio. \"I would call yesterday's move a hawkish cut,\" Haywood says, adding, \"I think the Fed was probably reluctant to make this cut. They may have backed themselves into a corner in a sense with their rhetoric in September.
