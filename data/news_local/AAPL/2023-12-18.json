Markets\n\nPublished12/18/2023, 08:58 AM\n\nS&P 500 Hovers Along New Medium-Term Highs: Is This a Topping Pattern?\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nSunshine Profits\nArticles(2452)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nDX\n-0.13%\n\nESZ25\n0.17%\n\nThe S&P 500 index lost 0.01% on Friday as it went sideways following the recent rally. On Wednesday and Thursday, the market rallied after the FOMC Statement release and on Friday investors were taking some profits off the table. On Thursday the daily high was at 4,738.57, and it was the highest since January of 2022.\nOn Wednesday the Fed basically announced a pivot in its monetary policy ‚Äì stocks, bond prices, precious metals rallied, and the US dollar sold off. Recently the S&P 500 broke above its late July local high of around 4,607. It resumed the rally from the October 27 local low of 4,103.78.\nStocks are expected to open 0.2% higher today. So the S&P 500 will further extend its short-term consolidation and for now, a relatively flat correction of the recent advances. The S&P 500 remains close to its new yearly high as we can see on the daily chart:\nFutures Contract Trades Along 4,780\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the hourly chart of the S&P 500 futures contract. It is still trading sideways. The nearest important resistance level is at 4,790-4,800 and the support level is at 4,750, among others.\nApple Stock Is Below Important $200 Mark\nLet‚Äôs move on to an individual stock. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most important market movers. On Thursday it reached new all-time high price of $199.62. Since then it‚Äôs going sideways, just like the broad stock market‚Äôs index. It looks like a topping pattern or just some flat correction following the rally. Nevertheless, $200 mark remains an important resistance level here.\nConclusion\nThe S&P 500 will likely continue its short-term consolidation this morning. On Thursday and Friday, there was a profit-taking action and uncertainty following the recent rally.\nThere have been no confirmed negative signals so far, but the market may see a downward correction at some point.\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown:\nThe S&P 500 trades sideways following its post-Fed rally.\nThere may be a downward correction at some point.\nIn my opinion, the short-term outlook is still bullish.\nThank you.\n\nS&P 500 Hovers Along New Medium-Term Highs: Is This a Topping Pattern?\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,902.50\n+68.3\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,592.90\n+8.6\n+0.13%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.10\n+0.34\n+2.30%\n\nDollar Index \n97.025\n-0.121\n-0.12%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.75\n+0.06\n+0.10%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.01\n+0.02\n+0.03%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.949\n+0.008\n+0.27%\n\nGold Futures\n3,677.80\n-8.60\n-0.23%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.673\n-0.157\n-0.37%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.654\n+0.0020\n+0.04%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.75\n-5.25\n-0.50%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.28\n0.00\n0.00%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.75\n-0.13\n-0.10%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what‚Äôs moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
