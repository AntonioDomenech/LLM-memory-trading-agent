Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nXOM\n0.02%\n\nHIG\n-0.53%\n\nTRV\n-0.18%\n\nDVN\n-1.47%\n\nCL\n0.21%\n\nPXD\n0.00%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nGrowth stocks continue to power markets despite early forecasts for 2023 to be another year of value outperformance\n\nQ1 earnings season is off to a decent start, and all eyes are on mega-cap tech.\n\nA trio of unusual earnings events within Energy and Financials that may offer clues on the market’s next move\n\nComing into the year, the mantra across Wall Street was to be long the banks and cyclicals. The “value” trade was in full swing following that style’s best year versus “growth” since 2000. As the market does, the script was flipped on the consensus – long-duration equities kickstarted the year with impressive gains, and many doubted if the rally could last since it was being propped up by a lot of the junky losers of 2022.\nThen mega-cap tech came to the rescue. Index stalwarts like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged, adding trillions to the collective market cap of the S&P 500.\nAs we venture further into earnings season – with a host of the former “FANG” names issuing Q1 results this week – will growth continue outshining value? Or will Financials and Energy-sector stocks claw their way back? That’s what the bulls might hope for – sector rotation is typically viewed as a bullish crosscurrent, so a baton toss to what outperformed the SPX for much of last year would be welcomed.\nKeeping Ahead of Volatility\nWall Street Horizon tracks more than 40 corporate event types on nearly 10,000 companies worldwide. On their own, traders and portfolio managers can so easily get lost in the key happenings across sectors and even with individual companies. We help market participants navigate this busy stretch of the calendar to stay ahead of and better manage risk.\nIs Oil M&A On the Way? \nFirst up on our radar is a company that has recently been the focus of some takeover chatter. Back on April 7, The Wall Street Journal reported that Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) may be the target of a buyout by sector leader ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Shares rose sharply the following trading day, all while the oil & gas niche continued to meander. As oil prices have retreated from nearly $130 in June last year to now around $80, there’s some semblance of market balance.\nPerhaps there are clues as to some news pending seen in PXD’s unusually early earnings date confirmed for April 26, AMC, with a conference call the following morning. Pioneer then hosts its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, May 25. The Energy company’s Q1 report comes with a –4.48 earnings date Z-score, indicative of an early outlier. Be on the lookout for unusual news, potentially positive, to be disclosed on the 26th.\nPXD has enjoyed a rebound in its stock price since oil faltered under $60 for a time in March. The $53 billion market cap exploration and production industry company has had high momentum over the previous few weeks, but shares remain sharply below their all-time high notched in Q2 last year.\nPioneer Natural Resources 3-Year Stock Price History: Shares Spike Amid Acquisition Chatter\n\nSource: Stockcharts.com\nHartford Financial: A Bearish Preliminary Earnings Report\nShifting gears to the embattled Financials sector, disappointing numbers were reported by Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) on April 13. The major insurance player issued a preliminary earnings report ahead of its April 27 Q1 reporting date. HIG tumbled about 3% immediately after the bearish preannouncement crossed the wires.\nWhat was the culprit? Like Travelers (NYSE:TRV) that recently issued results, a slew of storms that socked the east and west coasts during the winter led to substantial catastrophe losses. Still, the firm said it was a share repurchaser in the quarter, and maybe the management team simply wanted to get the bad news out of the way. Still, bearish preannouncements are often not a good thing and can portend more negative news in the actual quarterly report. Value investors should indeed parse through the upcoming profit report.\nAmid a flurry of troubling industry news in the last two months, HIG is simply in its trading range that began more than two years ago. Before the Silicon Valley Bank crisis and Financials sector turmoil that ensued for a few days, the Connecticut-based insurer held support on the chart and has since rebounded.\nHartford Financial 3-Year Stock Price History: Shares Rangebound\n\nSource: Stockcharts.com\nDevon Energy: A Late Earnings Date\nLastly, let’s go back to the Energy sector and drill down into Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN). The Oklahoma-based $36 billion market cap E&P name is one of the sell-side’s favorites for its strong free cash flow and low price-to-earnings ratio. With a forward operating P/E under 8, value investors love to buy the dip on this oil play. But we spotted a red flag.\nDVN has a confirmed Q1 earnings date of Monday, May 8, AMC, with a conference call the following morning. That is six calendar days later than its previously inferred and unconfirmed May 2 reporting date. The Z-score is 2.54. While not a massive outlier, it's still later than we would expect, so bearish news could be reported. Recall back in February, the S&P 500-listed company missed its adjusted EPS expectation.\nDevon Energy 3-Year Stock Price History: Recovering From 52-Week Lows\n\nSource: Stockcharts.com\nThe Bottom Line\nIt has been a solid start to earnings season, but a strong equity market rally leading into the reporting period makes for a high hurdle in terms of stock price reactions. Big tech names report this week but keep your eye on what’s happening within Energy and Financials.\n\nUnusual Earnings Events in Energy and Financials Offer Clues on Market’s Next Move\n\nView all comments (2)2\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,901.50\n+67.3\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,592.90\n+8.6\n+0.13%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.09\n+0.33\n+2.24%\n\nDollar Index \n97.007\n-0.139\n-0.14%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.82\n+0.13\n+0.21%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.07\n+0.08\n+0.12%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.952\n+0.011\n+0.37%\n\nGold Futures\n3,679.60\n-6.80\n-0.18%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.663\n-0.167\n-0.39%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.655\n+0.0030\n+0.06%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,041.13\n-4.88\n-0.47%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.30\n+0.02\n+0.01%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.74\n-0.14\n-0.11%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nAmazon's revenue keeps growing despite challenges, but increasing costs lead to a seventh consecutive quarter drop in EPS.\nAWS growth slows, but overall revenue growth is expected to outpace costs from Q2, while subscription and advertising segments show promise.\nThe S&P 500 has lost momentum this month – watch for a breakout of the 4065-4200 range to signal the next trend.\nAmazon reports its Q1 2023 earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, April 27.\nAccording to analyst estimates, Amazon is expected to report $0.22 in EPS on $124.6B in revenues.\nAmazon earnings preview\nDespite the decline in e-commerce demand, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue keeps growing due to its cloud-computing arm, subscription services, and rapidly expanding advertising business. However, rising costs are outpacing revenue growth and impacting margins, leading to an anticipated seventh consecutive quarterly drop in EPS during the first three months of 2023.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the main profit driver, is predicted to report a 14% revenue growth in Q1, which is less than half the growth rate from the previous year, as businesses become more cautious with their cloud spending. This slowdown is expected to persist, contributing to lower margins and profits. Nevertheless, Amazon is willing to forgo profits to maintain its leadership position and support clients during challenging times.\nThe slowdown in AWS may prompt Amazon to better control costs across the entire company. Although expenses have exceeded revenue growth for some time, Wall Street analysts project that the top line will grow faster than costs starting from Q2, resulting in a rebound in margins after they reach their lowest point in the three months leading up to June.\nIn e-commerce, third-party sales growth is slowing down but still expected to continue while online sales decline. Analysts anticipate online sales to recover in Q2 and accelerate in H2 as the company faces easier comparisons.\nSince the pandemic-driven boom, Amazon's subscription growth has slowed but remained steady (forecasted 10.9% increase in Q1), indicating the high-value customers place on its Prime service. Advertising, one of the fastest-growing segments, is expected to see a 15.8% revenue increase in Q1; however, this growth rate has also slowed due to the broader downturn.\nS&P 500 technical analysis\nAmazon accounts for nearly 3% of the overall S&P 500, the third highest weight among all stocks behind just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), so the e-commerce giant’s results will have a big impact on the index. Looking at the S&P 500 chart, volatility has dried up in April, with March’s strong bullish momentum evaporating ahead of key resistance at 4,200.\n\nSource: TradingView\nFor now, the technical outlook for the index is neutral, though a break below previous-resistance-turned-support at 4065 would flip the near-term outlook in favor of the bulls. Meanwhile, it will likely take a rally above 4200 to reinvigorate the bullish narrative for a continuation toward 4300+.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nCan Amazon’s Earnings Report Spark a Broad Market Rally?\n\nView all comments (2)2\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,901.50\n+67.3\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,592.90\n+8.6\n+0.13%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.09\n+0.33\n+2.24%\n\nDollar Index \n97.007\n-0.139\n-0.14%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.82\n+0.13\n+0.21%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.07\n+0.08\n+0.12%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.952\n+0.011\n+0.37%\n\nGold Futures\n3,679.60\n-6.80\n-0.18%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.663\n-0.167\n-0.39%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.655\n+0.0030\n+0.06%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,041.13\n-4.88\n-0.47%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.30\n+0.02\n+0.01%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.74\n-0.14\n-0.11%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
