The social media platform pleads its case before the January 19 deadline for the divest-or-ban to take effect. CNET technology reporter Abrar Al-Heeti joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss what users should expect as a TikTok ban looms. \"Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,\" Al-Heeti explains. \"Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable.\" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a \"strong TikTok competitor\" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.
