Markets\n\nPublished05/31/2022, 05:19 PM\n\nWhy Apple Shares Should Be Part Of Your Retirement Portfolio Now\n\nView all comments (6)6\n\nInvesting.com\nArticles(7970)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nBRKa\n-0.63%\n\nApple offers a unique combination to boost the total return in the shape of capital growth, dividends, and a share buyback plan\nWarren Buffett has built a $159-billion stake in Apple to benefit from the company’s unique growth prospects\nApple is betting on resilient demand for its devices due to its comparatively wealthier customer base and the strength of its software and services ecosystem\nIf you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingPro+\n\nIf your investment goal is to build a portfolio which could produce sustainable income during retirement, then it makes sense to look for blue-chip companies that have strong balance sheets, dependable dividends, and a history of hiking their payouts.\nA portfolio built on such stocks will most likely be able to weather recessions, resist inflationary pressures, and endure through price bubbles which often occur in the aftermath of relaxed monetary policies.\nCompanies that offer reliable and predictable dividends, as well as long-term growth potential, can help provide income no matter how rough the market waters get.\nSince it's a growth stock, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is generally not considered a good fit for retirement portfolios. And unlike the market’s defensive areas—such as utilities, telecom and consumer staples—shares of the iPhone maker have limited appeal as an income producer for retirees given the stock's meager 0.6% dividend yield. Plus, its status as a technology company makes it a member of a highly volatile segment of the market that retirees often avoid.\nYet, despite these disadvantages, there's still a strong case to be made for Apple as part of a diversified retirement portfolio.\n\nApple, in our view, offers a unique combination of benefits in the shape of capital growth, increasing dividends, and a massive share buyback plan—all of which could boost an investor's total return. While Apple has been increasing its dividend 10% on average during the past five years, it has also been buying back its shares, providing additional value to stakeholders.\nApple authorized $90 billion in share buybacks last quarter, after spending $88.3 billion on buybacks in 2021, the biggest outlay among listed companies in the US. Long-term, buy-and-hold investors love repurchase programs as they reduce a company’s share count and lift earnings, especially during turbulent times such as what we’re now facing.\nWarren Buffett’s Love for Apple\nRenowned investor Warren Buffett, whose holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) is one of the largest shareholders of Apple, has benefited immensely from this trend. Buffett has built a $159-billion stake in Apple since Berkshire Hathaway started buying the stock in late 2016.\nThe 91-year-old investor is a fan of CEO Tim Cook’s stock buyback strategy because it gives Berkshire increased ownership of each dollar of the smartphone and computer company's earnings each year. During the BRK shareholder meeting in April Buffett said:\n″...[W]e knew that we would own an even greater interest if they kept buying their shares, which we didn’t have any insider information or anything but certainly would seem the way to bet. They just reported their March quarter and, you know, they earned more money and they had fewer shares outstanding.”\nWith about $200 billion in cash on hand, Apple is in an enviable position of easily being able to further increase its share repurchase program in order to support its stock.\nIts focus on the cash-return program doesn’t mean that Apple is lacking in innovation and new ideas. Apple continues to have a lot of potential to surprise The Street despite the current challenging operating environment in which supply-chain disruptions are hurting its manufacturing in China.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company is betting on resilient demand for its devices due to its comparatively wealthier customer base and the strength of its software and services ecosystem which is fueling sales of hardware, Bloomberg reported this month.\nAAPL is also seeing less competition now that fierce rival Huawei Technologies has been shut out of markets. Huawei, once the No. 1 phone maker by shipments, has seen revenue fall for six consecutive quarters.\nBottom Line\nAt a time when investors are increasingly concerned about the economy and the performance of high-growth shares, Apple is a defensive stock that is well-positioned to weather a possible downturn. Now more than ever, it makes sense to treat Apple as a retirement stock that's ideal for buy-and-hold investors.\n***\nInterested in finding your next great stock idea?

Learned From Trading Profit Made Shorting Stocks\n\nView all comments (8)8\n\nChris Vermeulen\nArticles(1162)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nJesse Lauriston Livermore (July 26, 1877 – Nov. 28, 1940) was an American stock trader who made a $100-million trading profit by shorting stocks in the great crash of 1929. He is considered a pioneer of day trading and was the basis for the main character of the best-selling trader’s book by Edwin Lefevre called Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.\nJesse Livermore stated:\n“When trading stocks I always look for favored groups to get weaker and collapse. This usually meant a correction was coming in the overall market.”\nThis is how Livermore called the market turn in 1907, and 1929, as the market leaders rolled over first.\nHere are some additional Livermore quotes that are relevant to our current market environment:\n\"Stocks are manipulated to their highest prices possible and then sold (distributed) to the public on the way down by selling the stock into the rallies.”\n“The big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements—that is, not in reading the tape, but in sizing up the entire market and its trend.”\n“The speculator who insists on trying to profit from daily minor movements will never be in a position to take advantage of the next important change market-wise when it occurs.”\n“After establishing my position all I had to do thereafter was just sit tight and let the market run its course.”\n“Cash was, is and always will be king.” “Always have cash in reserve.” “Often, money that is just sitting can later be moved into the right situation at the right time and make a vast fortune.”\n“There are times when a trader must be out of the market and waiting on the sidelines.”\nLivermore also correctly stated that “What has happened in the past will happen again, and again, and again. This is because human nature does not change, and it is human emotion, solidly built into human nature, that always gets in the way of human intelligence.”\nWe don’t have to look too far to find favored stocks whose prices have completely collapsed. But to keep things reasonable let’s just look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a stock that was highly favored that has recently been experiencing weakness.\n\nApple Dropped 27.36%\nApple is a popular American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, software and online services. Interesting side note: Apple now has cash and marketable securities that exceed $200 billion.\nApple was one of the most favored stocks in 2020-2021. It rallied from a March 2020 low of $53 all the way up to its January 2022 high of $183. It then experienced a three-month sell-off, where it gave up about –18.04%. However, it immediately followed that downswing with an impressive $30 rally of 20%. But that rally turned out to be nothing more than distribution at the top, as the stock then plummeted by $50 per share, a 26.42% decline, as it breached $132.\n\nAnatomy Of A Trade Using Price\nWhen using price to trade, it is a good idea to measure the price swings and record their movements: dollar amount, a percentage amount, number of bars and number of days. We then utilize this information to let the market tell us what to do and when we should do it.\nThe following examples will act as a price guide to walk us through the process of measuring, using and benefiting from the knowledge we glean from looking closer at the price swing action:\n\nAPPLE  Downswing\nThis downswing was from September-October 2021: it measured $19, a 12.06% drop, 38-bars, 27 days.\n\nAPPLE INC • AAPL • NASDAQ • 4-HOUR• UPSWING\nThis upswing was from October 2021 – to January 2022: it measured +$44.66, +32.28%, 127 bars and 91-days. It was more than two times greater in price and three-times greater in time than the previous downswing.\n\nAPPLE INC • AAPL • NASDAQ • 4-HOUR• DOWNSWING\nThis downswing was from January 2022 to March 2022. It measured -$33.04, -18.04%, 94 bars and 68 days. Its percentage of -18.04% exceeded the previous downswing of -12.06%. This increase in percentage is a big red flag as the price is telling us that the trend is changing.\n\nAPPLE INC • AAPL • NASDAQ • 4-HOUR • UPSWING\nThis upswing was from March 14, 2022 – to March 29, 2022: it measured +$29.62, +19.73%, 23 bars and 15 days. This upswing gave us the perfect opportunity to liquidate our long position or at the very least downsize our position.\n\nAPPLE INC • AAPL • NASDAQ • 4-HOUR • DOWNSWING\nThis downswing was from March 2022 – to May 2022. It measured -$47.50, -26.39%, 73 bars and 51 days. Its percentage of -26.39% exceeds both previous downswings of -18.04% and -12.06%. This increase in percentage confirms that we are now in a downtrend.\n\nAs the market is currently working on an upswing, we should keep in mind that the previous upswing was +$29.62 or +19.73%. Apple is giving us another opportunity to liquidate any remaining holdings anywhere from our current price level to over $160.\n\nThe Sign That The Trend For Apple Has Changed\nIt should also be noted that the 2020 COVID downswing from Jan. 29, 2020 to March 23, 2020, was -$29.50, -35.85%, 74 bars and 53 days.\nThe current 2022 downswing from the $183 peak to the $132.50 low is -$50.68, -27.67%, 193 bars and 139 days.\nThe 2022 downswing exceeds the 2020 COVID downswing in both price and time: -$50.68 vs -$29.50, and 139 days vs 53 days. This is a major red flag signal that the trend in Apple has changed.\nLet us remember Jesse Livermore stated: “When trading stocks I always look for favored groups to get weaker and collapse.” “This usually meant a correction was coming in the overall market.”\nThis is how Livermore called the market turn in 1907, and 1929, as the market leaders rolled over first.\n\nLessons Learned From Trading Profit Made Shorting Stocks\n\nView all comments (8)8\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,900.50\n+66.3\n+0.14%\n\nUS 500 \n6,594.40\n+10.1\n+0.15%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n14.76\n+0.05\n+0.34%\n\nDollar Index \n97.242\n+0.096\n+0.10%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.71\n+0.02\n+0.03%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.23\n+0.24\n+0.36%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.972\n+0.031\n+1.05%\n\nGold Futures\n3,675.90\n-10.50\n-0.28%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.63\n-0.200\n-0.47%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6605\n+0.0085\n+0.18%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,043.13\n-3.13\n-0.30%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.089\n+0.030\n+0.74%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.704\n+0.025\n+0.53%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.647\n+0.022\n+0.61%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.035\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.13\n-0.16\n-0.14%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.60\n-0.28\n-0.21%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
