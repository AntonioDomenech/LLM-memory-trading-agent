things shape economic perceptions more than the prices people pay daily at the grocery store, shopping center, or gas pump. And as 2022 wrapped up, the retail sector once again likely reflected how consumers grasp sudden shocks to their household finances.\nBased on how December U.S. Retail Sales looked, the answer is likely not terribly well. As inflation shot up in 2022, every retail category but grocery, building materials and sporting goods took a tumble.\nThis isn‚Äôt the first recent holiday season to test retailers. In 2020, it was a global health crisis that reset workplaces, personal savings, and available goods. In 2021, another burst of COVID-19 hit in December and sales dropped below expectations. And at the end of 2022, it was 10 months of spiraling inflation that peaked at 40-year highs after an extended near-zero rate environment during the two previous years.\nSo we know the big headlines. How will retailers see the picture as they report Q4 results in the coming weeks? Did consumers close their wallets overall, or did they simply divert that spending toward travel, dining out and other ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù that were so limited during the worst days of the pandemic?\nRemember‚Äîwhat happens in households often portends what‚Äôs next for the global economy. After all, consumer spending comprises roughly 70% of Gross Domestic Product.\nFor now, let‚Äôs look at trends that likely shaped the final quarter and what could be revealed in Q4 results starting mid-month:\nBlack Friday got bleaker: As of last week,U.S. retail sales figures had fallen in three of the last four months. But December was the real eye-opener (see Figure 1) because many consumers basically froze their spending in the retail economy that had been so robust since the pandemic. You probably know what happened to spending on personal and business technology and to companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). We‚Äôll get fresh retail sales numbers for January on February 15.\nInflation‚Äôs pinch seems far from over:On February 3, January‚Äôs employment figures managed to pin the market‚Äôs ears back in more ways than one. Retailers may have cheered data indicating worker demand remains strong‚Äîproviding at least some evidence that customers still have money to spend. But retailers also feel wage pressure. Then there‚Äôs the question of how much disposable income is really out there. In December, a study from PYMNTS and LendingClub (NYSE:LC) reported that 63% of Americans were living ‚Äúpaycheck to paycheck,‚Äù with a notable increase among consumers making more than $100,000 per year. If hiring and wage levels finally start to recede, we may see staffing and store count changes at some retailers and more extreme decisions at others, such as long-troubled Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), which announced plans to shutter nearly 90 stores just last week.\nRevolving credit rates keep rising: Academics and economists will likely be studying‚Äîand debating‚Äîthe effects of COVID-19 stimulus programs for years to come. But consider what federal aid did for household savings (see Figure 2) and how quickly that cushion lost stuffing when aid began to shut off at midyear 2021 and 40-year inflation began to settle in. When prices go up, many households make do with credit card spending, and Bankrate reports the average credit card rate is up 4 percentage points since last March to an average 20%. And though credit delinquencies are still at historic lows, TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) thinks that serious credit card delinquencies may rise this year to their highest levels since 2010.\nFigure 1: SANTA SLIDE. Since U.S. interest rates started rising back in March 2022, shoppers have been rethinking purchases. By December, the Advance Real Retail and Food Services Sales (RRSFS: FRED) data showed a particularly steep downturn in December, retail‚Äôs most important month. If consumers were spending, they didn‚Äôt seem to be doing all that much of it in stores. Data sources: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart source: The thinkorswim¬Æ platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. \n\nFigure 2: FAREWELL TO THE CUSHION. The nation‚Äôs Personal Savings rate (SAVERT:FRED) was at historic highs during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then tapered off steadily as federal economic stimulus programs began to wind down. Then inflation began to rise. For some, that might mean more credit card usage to make ends meet. Data sources: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Chart source: The thinkorswim¬Æ platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nWrapping up a worrisome year\nWill there be many earnings surprises in the upcoming Q4 retail sector numbers? We‚Äôll have to see, but revised guidance in retail leading up to the holiday shopping season already made plenty of news this year.\nIf you read our Q3 Retail Earnings Preview, we talked about a pullback in once-heavy holiday hiring as retailers continued to wrestle with wholesale prices, shipping costs, and continued supply chain headaches affecting what would finally make it to the shelves.\nResearch shows it was a fairly interesting quarter for certain retail sub-sectors as well.\nAs of late January, FactSet estimated the consumer discretionary sector had the second-largest year-over-year earnings decline across all 11 S&P 500¬Æ industry sectors at ‚Äì20.6%. The research firm said six of the 10 industries in the sector are expected to see a year-over-year decrease in earnings, with four of those six industries down more than 10%:\nInternet and direct marketing retail (‚Äì84%)\nMultiline retail (‚Äì30%)\nHousehold durables (‚Äì13%)\nTextiles, apparel, and luxury goods (‚Äì11%)\nHowever, there‚Äôs a big caveat in that first bullet above. Its name is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). AMZN‚Äôs Q4 earnings picture came in less than rosy on Friday, and FactSet said it was the ‚Äúlargest contributor to the earnings decline for consumer discretionary‚Äù as a whole. Without AMZN, the full sector‚Äôs year-over-year Q4 earnings growth would be 16.1%.\nSo, it‚Äôs all about digging deeper. As you listen to various retailers‚Äô earnings calls, here are a few questions to keep in mind:\nAs inflation and requisite rate hikes take a bigger bite out of both lower- and higher-income paychecks for a longer period of time, how will that affect retailers serving customers with more discretionary income, such as Macy‚Äôs (M) or Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), or generally less, such as Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT)?\nMargins were squeezed throughout 2022‚Äîwhat was the final Q4 impact and are they likely to improve this year?\nWhere do retail supply chain challenges stand right now‚Äîfrom securing merchandise to the costs of last-mile delivery‚Äîand will these strategies change?\nSome retailers sprung eye-opening policy changes on consumers this holiday season, including the return of restocking fees, and stricter return policies. How did consumers react, and will such policies continue?\nWhat retail technology investments paid off for companies by year-end, and where might they be expanded?\nIf the job market really does slow down in 2023, how will stores pivot in hiring practices and brick-and-mortar strategies?\nTHE POWER OF LIPSTICK. Walmart (WMT‚Äîred line) managed a modest recovery since inflation became last year‚Äôs big economic story, but higher-end mass category leaders like Macy‚Äôs (M‚Äîpink line) and Target (NYSE:TGT) (TGT‚Äîblue line) are still fighting their way back. However, hair and cosmetic chain Ulta (ULTA‚Äîgray line) hit Q3 earnings out of the park with a significant gain in share price ‚Äîhow will other specialty niche retailers look as good once Q4 data comes in? Data sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim¬Æ platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick look at what to watch for as the following retail leaders report.\nWalmart (WMT)\nExpected report date: Tuesday, February 21, before the open\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô consensus): $1.50\nYear-ago EPS: $1.53\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: ‚Äì1.96%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô consensus): $159.36 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $152.87 billion\nWhat to watch: Consumers wrestling with higher food and gas prices managed to show WMT loyalty this year within their Sam‚Äôs Club warehouse operation. After seeing sharp growth in membership and sales from the pandemic through today, Walmart announced last month it plans to open 30 new stores in ‚Äúhigh-growth suburban areas‚Äù where the Sam‚Äôs Club locations are few and far between. It‚Äôs the first time WMT has launched a major Sam‚Äôs expansion in more than a decade. It‚Äôs not just about Sam‚Äôs, though. Competing warehouse retailers Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and BJ‚Äôs Wholesale Club (BJ) also gained significant membership after gasoline prices spiked last year.\nHome Depot and Lowe‚Äôs \nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) expected report date: Tuesday, February 21, before the open\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô consensus): $2.24\nYear-ago EPS: $1.78\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: +2.1%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô average estimate): $36.01 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $35.72 billion\nLowe‚Äôs Companies (NYSE:LOW) expected report date: Wednesday, March 1, before the open\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô consensus): $3.28\nYear-ago EPS: $3.21\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: +25.8%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô average estimate): $22.78 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $21.34 billion\nWhat to watch: Mortgage rates spiraled in 2022, and as of late January, existing home sales were down for the 11th straight month. Regardless of where the housing picture goes in 2023, the rivalry is getting more interesting between the nation‚Äôs two largest home improvement chains. Barron‚Äôs recently reported that Lowe‚Äôs is trading at ‚Äúa discount to its larger rival and the S&P 500,‚Äù adding that Lowe‚Äôs has an operating profit margin of just under 13% compared to HD‚Äôs 15% with plans to raise that number to 14.5% ‚Äúby around 2026.‚Äù\nTarget (TGT)\nExpected report date: Tuesday, February 28, before the open\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô consensus): $1.39\nYear-ago EPS: $3.19\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: ‚Äì56.4%%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô consensus): $30.7 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $31 billion\nWhat to watch: The upscale discounter was among the first major retailers in 2022 to signal trouble, reporting inventory problems in Q2. In its Q3 report, TGT cut Q4 earnings guidance and said it expects its first comparable sales decline in five years. TGT became the poster child for pandemic-era overstocking and paid for it. Most analysts don‚Äôt think the situation has improved much.\nMacy‚Äôs (M)\nExpected report date: Early March\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô consensus): $1.57\nYear-ago EPS: $2.45\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: ‚Äì35.9%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô consensus): $8.25 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $8.66 billion\nWhat to watch: In early January, M issued guidance that its revenues would be at the lower end of guidance, but CEO Jeff Gennette believes the consumer ‚Äúwill continue to be pressured in 2023, particularly in the first half.‚Äù As for the recent holiday season, he said ‚Äúthe lulls of the nonpeak holiday weeks were deeper than anticipated,‚Äù foreshadowing the disappointing U.S. retail sales report issued January 18.\nNordstrom (JWN)\nExpected report date: Thursday, March 2, after the close\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô consensus): $0.71\nYear-ago EPS: $1.23\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: ‚Äì42.3%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô consensus): $4.33 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $4.49 billion\nWhat to watch: GameStop (NYSE:GME) Chairman and meme stock investor Ryan Cohen turned his attention to the Seattle-based department store retailer Nordstrom after it cut its full-year guidance due to the slow holiday season. On Friday, JWN shares rose more than 20% after TheWall Street Journal reported Cohen took a ‚Äúmajor stake‚Äù in the department store company.\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA)\nExpected report date: Thursday, March 2, before open\nExpected Q4 EPS (analysts‚Äô average estimate): $5.57\nYear-ago EPS: $5.41\nExpected year-over-year EPS change: +3.0%\nExpected Q4 revenue (analysts‚Äô average estimate): $3.01 billion\nYear-ago revenue: $2.73 billion\nWhat to watch: Ulta, a hair-and-beauty chain, stood out last year. As workers head back to the office, into job interviews, back to business travel, or simply out on the town, beauty has been a sturdy product and service category across all specialty and department stores, according to analysts. And this year‚Äôs Q4 holiday party season was probably the best in years. However, early in January, Barron‚Äôs reported that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) downgraded ULTA to underweight from equal weight because it believes ULTA‚Äôs operating margins could fall back to pre-COVID-19 levels now that the economy is mostly reopened.\nWe‚Äôll see if the party continues in 2023.\n\nRetail Earnings Preview: Will Inflation‚Äôs Chill Deliver the Iciest Holiday Season\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,894.00\n+59.8\n+0.13%\n\nUS 500 \n6,594.90\n+10.6\n+0.16%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.08\n+0.32\n+2.17%\n\nDollar Index \n97.114\n-0.032\n-0.03%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n63.03\n+0.34\n+0.54%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.32\n+0.33\n+0.49%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.972\n+0.031\n+1.05%\n\nGold Futures\n3,679.42\n-6.98\n-0.19%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.708\n-0.122\n-0.29%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6602\n+0.0082\n+0.18%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,044.63\n-1.38\n-0.13%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.077\n+0.018\n+0.44%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.699\n+0.020\n+0.43%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.635\n+0.010\n+0.28%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.035\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.20\n-0.08\n-0.07%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.69\n-0.19\n-0.15%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

That didn‚Äôt stop 20% of the members of Congress who traded stocks and options from beating the market, a number that is higher than that of professional money managers over time.\nFormer Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has seen increased scrutiny over the trades made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist.
