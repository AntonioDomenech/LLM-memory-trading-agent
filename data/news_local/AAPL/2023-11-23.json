Companies will likely focus on progressing toward a universal interface, removing friction and agentic AI integration, he said. These factors will determine user adoption and engagement, he said.\nNowak sees Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) as the best-positioned to enable personal AI assistant technology, followed by Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\nFuture Of Search: Alphabet’s OpenAI rival Gemini will likely improve accuracy rates and reduce hallucination and likely narrow the competitive gap between OpenAI and Google, Nowak said.\nAI Creator Tools: All eyes are on whether 2024 will see scaled generative AI creative tools and how these will impact broader engagement trends, the analyst said.

Royal Caribbean Cruises\nYear-To-Date Performance: +112.3%\nMarket Cap: $26.9 Billion\nIn a testament to recovering travel and tourism trends, Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) Cruises, which is the world’s largest cruise operator, has given shareholders plenty of reasons to be grateful this Thanksgiving.\nThe Miami-based cruise giant has seen a resurgence this year as the travel industry continues to rebound from the negative impact of the Covid pandemic.\nRoyal Caribbean's strategies to enhance safety measures, revamp the cruise experience, and capitalize on the ongoing improvement in travel demand have contributed to its robust year-to-date performance.\nRCL stock - which began trading at $50.54 on January 3 and rose all the way to a 2023 peak of $112.95 on July 28 - has gained 112.3% in 2023, making it the third-best performer on the S&P 500 this year, trailing only Nvidia, and Meta Platforms.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nAll things considered, Royal Caribbean shares should continue appreciating as the travel company is poised to grow its earnings thanks to improving profitability trends.\nIt is worth mentioning that RCL currently has an above-average InvestingPro ‘Financial Health’ score of 3.2/5.0 due to strong earnings and sales growth prospects.\n2. PulteGroup\nYear-To-Date Performance: +93.2%\nMarket Cap: $19 Billion\nPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), the third largest home construction company in the United States, has been on a tear this year as it capitalizes on strong housing demand, largely driven by favorable supply and demand trends.\nThe Atlanta-based homebuilder, which mainly sells single-family homes, has demonstrated a higher backlog, healthy earnings, and robust sales growth thanks to thriving demand for new homes.\nIts strategic land acquisition, aggressive share buybacks, and increasing annual dividend depict a strong outlook. Thus, this Thanksgiving, investors in PulteGroup have reasons to be optimistic.\nPHM stock, which rose to a record high of $89.10 on Wednesday after starting the year at $46.40, is up 93.2% year-to-date, making it the fourth best performer on the S&P 500.\nSource: InvestingPro\nLooking ahead, PulteGroup looks set for further capital appreciation, as the homebuilding company's top and bottom lines are expected to grow considerably, courtesy of higher revenues and margin improvement.\nIt should be noted that even after the stock has nearly doubled since the start of the year, PHM remains undervalued at the moment according to InvestingPro, and could see an increase of 36.4% from the current market value.\n3. Adobe\nYear-To-Date Performance: +84.2%\nMarket Cap: $282.2 Billion\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)'s innovative software solutions and a strong foothold in creative and digital marketing tools have secured its position as one of the top performers in the S&P 500 this year.\nThe San Jose, California-based software-as-a-service powerhouse has continued to innovate and provide valuable tools in the digital space thanks to its growing involvement in artificial intelligence.\nAdobe’s commitment to enhancing its suite of software, leveraging expanding digital transformation trends, and delivering consistent customer value makes it a stock for its holders to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.\nSource: InvestingPro\nADBE began the year at $340.16 and closed at an all-time high of $619.73 last night, representing a year-to-date gain of 84.2%.\nAdobe looks poised for further gains in 2024 as the current operating environment fuels demand for its wide array of subscription-based digital media and marketing software tools.\nAs Investing Pro points out, the tech titan currently enjoys a ‘Financial Health’ score of 4/5, thanks to strong earnings prospects, and a healthy profitability outlook.\n4. General Electric\nYear-To-Date Performance: +83%\nMarket Cap: $130.2 Billion\nGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) has emerged as one of the top performers in the S&P 500 this year, which makes GE a stock to be especially grateful for this Thanksgiving.\nThe multinational conglomerate has thrived due to its diversification across various sectors like aviation, healthcare, and renewable energy. The Boston-based company, which was founded in 1892, beat Wall Street’s profit and sales estimates in every quarter this year as it reaps the benefits of its diversified portfolio, strategic initiatives, as well as cost-cutting measures.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nGeneral Electric has been on a major uptrend throughout most of the year, with shares soaring 83% in 2023. The stock - which began trading at $65.59 on January 3 - ended at $119.66 yesterday, the highest closing price since November 2017.\nEven with the recent upswing, GE remains undervalued and could see an increase of 35%, according to InvestingPro, bringing shares closer to their ‘Fair Value’ of $161.45.\nDemonstrating the strength and resilience of its business, General Electric sports a near-perfect Investing Pro ‘Financial Health’ score of 4 out of 5.\n5. Arista Networks\nYear-To-Date Performance: +79.4%\nMarket Cap: $67 Billion\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET), a key player in the networking technology sector, has carved a niche with its innovative solutions and has been successful in grabbing market share from chief rivals Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR).\nThe Santa Clara, California-based networking-infrastructure company's focus on cloud networking, data center solutions, and its role in advancing network infrastructure has made it a standout performer, earning plenty of gratitude from stockholders this year.\nSource: InvestingPro\nANET stock closed at a new record peak of $217.69 on Wednesday, earning the company a valuation of $67 billion.\nShares have scored a gain of almost 80% in 2023, making it the 11th best performer on the S&P 500 this year.\nNot surprisingly, Arista Network’s stock is substantially undervalued according to the quantitative models in Investing Pro: with a ‘Fair Value’ price target of around $249, ANET shares could see an upside of 14.4% from current levels.\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.
