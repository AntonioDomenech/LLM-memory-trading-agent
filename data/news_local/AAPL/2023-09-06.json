Markets\n\nPublished09/06/2023, 03:37 PM\n\nStocks Likely to Avoid the September Effect as AI Hype Continues\n\nView all comments (3)3\n\nThe Tokenist\nArticles(1160)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nDJI\n-0.59%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nIn investing, considering all available factors can be the difference between a loss and a profit. The September Effect is one of those factors that sits in the background noise of market signals. Sometimes, perception plays a role in market dynamics as expectations feed back into investor action. Whether real or not, how does the “month to avoid stock” play out this time?\nWhat is the September Effect?\nIn the United States, the fiscal year ends on September 30. This is the time for preparing financial statements across the federal government and many organizations. In such a period, investors restructure assets to lock in tax losses and profits, which may lead to stock liquidations. It would then be no accident that this period coincides with the perceived September effect, later followed by the January effect.\nAs market anomalies, both effects manifest as downturns without apparent cause that can be easily quantified. Being neither predictive nor consistent, the September Effect is another vague signal that asset underperformance could be expected.\nJeremy Siegel of the Wharton School of Business Administration attempted to quantify the September Effect in the paper “September: A Month to Avoid Stocks”. The finance professor concluded that the Dow Jones industrial average dropped in 63 September's from 1890 to 1994, only to rise across 41 September's.\nHowever, it cannot be conclusively stated that September is the worst-performing month. Moreover, in recent decades, the perceived effect is further waning in consistency. So much so that Siegel himself, in last Friday’s Behind the Markets podcast, is optimistic for this September.\nMacro Factors that Defy September Expectations\nOtherwise known as the “Wizard of Wharton,” the retired professor cited several factors for a bullish outlook. One of the indicators comes from resilient housing prices, which are certainly more resilient than expected.\nCase-Shiller Home Price Index shows an increase by 0.7% in June. Image courtesy of TradingEconomicsThis may seem unusual given that mortgage rates surpassed 7%, but most housing market has rates locked in under 5%. In turn, houses are locked in, keeping the supply lower than demand for the time being. Siegel believes investors are now treating both stocks and homes as inflation hedges.\nRegarding the underlying dynamic between the Fed’s interest rates and inflation, Siegel noted that the inflation rate is now sufficiently low for the Fed to remain in standby mode.\n“The likelihood that the Fed will raise in September is now almost nil, and in fact it puts the November increase in doubt”\nThis likelihood increases if the labor market continues to loosen up, a concurrent theme across all FOMC meetings since the hiking cycle began in March 2022. Inflation can only sustainably decrease if people have less money to pay for goods and services.\n“The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.”\nJerome Powell at the annual Jackson Hole conference in August 2023The latest JOLTS data for July shows a drop of 338,000 job openings; this signals the Fed to stay the course without more rate hikes. This would signal to the market that capital will not get even more expensive. \nTweaked Data Goes Against September Effect\nIf the September Effect is taken for granted, what if the trend considers this year’s paradigm precisely? The stock market went up until July, only to weaken in August. Accounting for 11 such historical instances, September doesn’t look that different from other months.\n\nThis time around, an apparent historical anomaly is the massive AI hype demonstrated by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alongside Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These stocks and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) represent a $7.2 trillion market cap. \nApple is yet to surprise the market with its AI offering, presently under works as Ajax generative AI. This may be announced alongside the unveiling of new major Apple products on September 12th in Cupertino, California. Investors expect these to be Apple Watch Series 9 and iPhone 15 Pro/Max.  The sentiment will likely spill over enough to countervail September Effect expectations if the market reception is positive.\n\nStocks Likely to Avoid the September Effect as AI Hype Continues\n\nView all comments (3)3\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,895.00\n+60.8\n+0.13%\n\nUS 500 \n6,594.10\n+9.8\n+0.15%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n14.76\n+0.05\n+0.34%\n\nDollar Index \n97.197\n+0.051\n+0.05%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.93\n+0.24\n+0.38%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.22\n+0.23\n+0.34%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.968\n+0.027\n+0.92%\n\nGold Futures\n3,674.45\n-11.95\n-0.32%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.68\n-0.150\n-0.35%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6575\n+0.0055\n+0.12%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,044.13\n-2.13\n-0.20%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.084\n+0.025\n+0.62%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.706\n+0.027\n+0.58%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.646\n+0.021\n+0.58%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.035\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.13\n-0.16\n-0.14%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.65\n-0.23\n-0.18%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nUS10YT=X\n0.57%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nXLE\n-0.59%\n\nXLV\n-1.15%\n\nUS20YT=X\n0.52%\n\nTech giants Apple and Microsoft declined for the month of August, as did the broader S&P 500.\nRising interest rates are culprits for the market's decline, although Apple and Microsoft issued disappointing guidance.\nIt's highly unusual for the S&P 500 to decline for two years in a row, which bodes well for 2023's return.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended August with a loss, finishing in the red for the first time since December.\nLikewise, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the S&P 500’s second-largest component, after Apple, ended to the downside in July and August. Microsoft, too, logged gains in each month from January through June.\nAre those two behemoths, which have huge sway over the market, dragging down the performance of the broader market and the tech sector, in particular?\nLet’s take a look at what’s going on with the S&P sectors.\nYear-to-date, tech is still the top dog, helped in no small way by the 237.72% gain in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nThe second-best performer is communications services, led by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)145.88% return.\nSeven Stocks Led The Market Through July\nIt’s been well documented that the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are responsible for more than 75% of the S&P’s return through July.\nAugust was only the second month of 2023 that the S&P closed lower, although the decline was just 1.63%, hardly reason to panic. In fact, it’s reasonable to expect a pullback after a gain of 19%.\nIn addition, sector rotation is a normal and expected phenomenon. In the past month, while nine of the 11 S&P sectors pulled back, the Energy Select Sector SPDR® Fund (NYSE:XLE) is up 4.21%, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR® Fund (NYSE:XLV) eked out a return of .09%.\nDespite a strong 2023 rally, the market still hasn’t made up enough ground to retain its January 3, 2022 high. Some analysts say the S&P won’t again be in bull market territory until it retakes that level. However, another indicator, the August 29 S&P gain of 1.45% in heavy turnover, shows the market following through on a rally that began on August 18. That’s a bullish sign.\nUnderwhelming Revenue Guidance\nApple’s revenue guidance disappointed, which resulted in a heavy-volume gap down, leading to the August decline.\nMicrosoft, too, issued weaker-than-expected guidance in late July, causing its pullback that month, and in August.\nBut if you’re wondering whether weakness in big techs like Apple and Microsoft is the only culprit in the market’s August monthly decline, you might want to look to something more pedantic: Bond yields.\nIt’s not always the favorite topic of stock traders and investors, but interest rates played a role in the market’s August decline. The rates on both 10-year and 20-year Treasuries rose in August. That means investors can get a solid return not only on bonds but on cash parked in money-market accounts.\nBlame The Fed?\nIn other words, there’s less incentive to put money at risk in equities. The Federal Reserve, in its efforts to put the kibosh on inflation, maybe more to blame for August’s market decline than Apple or Microsoft.\nHowever, tech, in particular, generally gets hit hard as interest rates rise. That’s because borrowing becomes costlier for companies, hindering their ability to finance new projects. Now you could definitely argue that neither Apple nor Microsoft or many other S&P techs would have trouble finding lenders, which is true, but they would have to pay higher rates on newly issued debt.\nAlthough uncertainties about interest rates, China’s economy, the U.S. job market, and other factors have the potential to sink stocks, it’s highly unusual for the S&P to close lower two years in a row. That bodes well for the index’s 2023 return.\nHistorically, the market tends to self-correct, as a big decline, such as we saw in 2022, often attracts value-oriented bargain shoppers.\nIn addition, as stocks other than techs rotate into S&P leadership, their impact on S&P return increases, meaning the index is less reliant on even the biggest stocks like Apple and Microsoft.\nOriginal Post\n\nApple, Microsoft to Blame for Dragging Down S&P 500?\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,895.00\n+60.8\n+0.13%\n\nUS 500 \n6,594.10\n+9.8\n+0.15%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n14.76\n+0.05\n+0.34%\n\nDollar Index \n97.197\n+0.051\n+0.05%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.93\n+0.24\n+0.38%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.22\n+0.23\n+0.34%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.968\n+0.027\n+0.92%\n\nGold Futures\n3,674.45\n-11.95\n-0.32%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.68\n-0.150\n-0.35%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6575\n+0.0055\n+0.12%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,044.13\n-2.13\n-0.20%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.084\n+0.025\n+0.62%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.706\n+0.027\n+0.58%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.646\n+0.021\n+0.58%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.035\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.13\n-0.16\n-0.14%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.65\n-0.23\n-0.18%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
