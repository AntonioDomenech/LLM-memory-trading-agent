Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nGOOG\n0.25%\n\nSNAP\n0.69%\n\nPINS\n0.20%\n\nShares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) are down on Wednesday after their September quarter results showed the challenging macro backdrop, which continues to hamper growth trends. \nMicrosoft shares fell 8% following missed expectations for FQ1‚Äôs cloud revenue and a worse-than-expected quarterly outlook. Revenue came in at $50.12 billion, up 11% year-over-year, while analysts were expecting $49.61 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.35, topping the consensus estimates of $2.30 per share, according to Refinitiv. \nMacro Headwinds\nMicrosoft‚Äôs income declined by 14% in the three-month period to $17.56 billion. The drop was in part because Microsoft extended the useful lives of servers and networking gear from 4 years to 6 years, denting its Q1 net income by $859 million. The company‚Äôs gross margin stood at 69.2% in the quarter, missing the consensus projection of 69.8%. \nMoreover, the company‚Äôs cloud division reported $20.33 billion in quarterly revenue, up 20% year-over-year and just below the consensus estimates of $20.36 billion. Microsoft‚Äôs flagship cloud computing service Azure reported revenue growth of 35% in the period, down from the 40% growth in the previous quarter and compared to analysts‚Äô estimates of 36.9%. \nThe unit‚Äôs growth has seen a slowdown due to higher energy costs amid rampant inflationary pressures, said the company‚Äôs CFO, Amy Hood. CEO Satya Nadella added that cyclical trends are weighing on the company‚Äôs consumer business. \nOn the earnings call, Microsoft said it expects Q2 revenue in the range of $52.35 billion to $53.35 billion, suggesting growth of roughly 2%. The outlook fell short of analysts‚Äô expectations of $56.05 billion. Similarly, the tech giant estimated a Q2 operating margin of 40%, also below the consensus estimates of 42%. \nMore importantly, Azure growth is expected to decline on a sequential basis by around 5% to about 37%, while analysts were expecting a 39.4% growth in the cloud computing business.\nShares of tech peers Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also headed lower as Microsoft suffered the weakest quarterly sales growth in the last five years. Moreover, soft guidance issued on the earnings call shows the management is fearful of very tricky quarters ahead. Investors‚Äô concerns are elevated amid moderating Azure growth that could limit the upside in Microsoft shares in the near term.\nAd Slowdown Worse Than Feared \nAlphabet reported worse-than-anticipated profit and revenue for the third quarter and announced plans to significantly cut headcount growth, sending the company‚Äôs shares down on Wednesday.\nThe Google owner reported EPS of $1.06 in the third quarter, short of the analysts‚Äô estimates of $1.25 per share, according to Refinitiv. Revenue stood at $69.09 in the period, also below the expectations of $70.58 billion. \nAlphabet generated $7.07 billion in YouTube advertising revenue, well below the estimated $7.42 billion. Google Cloud revenue beat expectations, with the unit generating $6.9 billion, compared to the estimated $6.69 billion. Traffic acquisition costs (TAC) amounted to $11.83 in the quarter, compared to the consensus estimates of $12.38.\nOverall revenue growth was down to 6% from 41% last year due to headwinds related to online ad spending. It marked the slowest growth period for Alphabet since 2013, excluding one period early in the COVID-19 pandemic. \nYouTube ad revenue declined 2% to $7.07 billion year-over-year, while analysts were projecting a 3% growth. Alphabet‚Äôs overall advertising revenue stood at $54.48 billion in Q3 2022, marking a moderate growth from the same period last year. \nDespite this, cloud-based systems remain on the rise in virtually everyaspect of the business. Likewise, on a more positive note, Google Cloud reported better-than-expected revenue of $6.9 billion, marking a sharp increase compared to the year-ago quarter of $5 billion. However, the cloud unit‚Äôs losses increased to $699 million from $644 million in the year-ago period. \nGoogle‚Äôs chief business officer Philipp Schindler, said the company saw a slowdown in ad spending for specific areas, including loans, insurance, crypto, and mortgage. Alphabet added that its total full-time employee headcount stands at 186,779, up from 150,028 year-over-year. \nThe company‚Äôs CEO Sundar Pichai said the Q4 headcount growth will be ‚Äúsignificantly lower‚Äù compared to Q3 as the company doubles down on ‚Äúmoderating expense growth.‚Äù \nAlphabet‚Äôs problematic Q3 report comes after Snap (NYSE:SNAP), another tech business that is reliant on the health of the ad market, warned about weakening demand for ad sales. After Snap‚Äôs warning sent shock across the digital advertising sector, Google‚Äôs Q3 report confirmed the slowdown is weaker-than-expected. \nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) are also trading lower on Wednesday as investors fear the entire social media sector will feel the heat of the slowdown.\nConclusion\nWhile traditionally considered blue-chip stocks, the soft earnings from Microsoft and Google show that not even the most prominent tech corporations are immune to ongoing macro headwinds. Analysts are lowering profit and sales estimates for 2023 to reflect slowing demand and macro headwinds that could only intensify once Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes take effect.\n\nEarnings Show Mega-Cap Growth Stocks Are Not Immune To Macro Headwinds\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,903.00\n+68.8\n+0.15%\n\nUS 500 \n6,594.50\n+10.2\n+0.16%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.06\n+0.30\n+2.03%\n\nDollar Index \n96.995\n-0.151\n-0.16%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.86\n+0.17\n+0.27%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.09\n+0.10\n+0.15%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.956\n+0.015\n+0.51%\n\nGold Futures\n3,680.92\n-5.48\n-0.15%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.683\n-0.148\n-0.34%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.659\n+0.0070\n+0.15%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,041.25\n-4.75\n-0.45%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.063\n+0.004\n+0.10%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.678\n-0.001\n-0.02%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.62\n-0.006\n-0.17%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.31\n+0.03\n+0.03%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.75\n-0.13\n-0.10%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what‚Äôs moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.

PM\n\nAmazon: Q3 Earnings To Disappoint, But Long-Term Growth Remains Intact\n\nView all comments (6)6\n\nHaris Anwar\nArticles(1312)\n\nFollow\n\nNDX\n0.42%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nAmazon is facing considerable weakness in its core e-commerce sales\nThe company's cloud and advertising businesses may come to rescue as growth in these areas still remains strong \nHurt by the economic headwinds, AMZN stock is down more than 30% this year, underperforming its large-cap tech counterparts\nIt won‚Äôt be such a big surprise if Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shows signs of losing growth momentum upon reporting earnings tomorrow after the market close. \nThe combination of 40-year high inflation with tight monetary conditions has consumers and ad companies cutting back on spending, damaging AMZN‚Äôs margins.\nFurthermore, since the end of the pandemic, the e-commerce giant has faced considerable weakness in its core e-commerce sales as shoppers stopped buying as many electronics or furniture to spare cash for outside eating, travel, and concerts. \nPressured by these challenges, Amazon‚Äôs North America division, which houses its core online retail business in its biggest market, reported a third consecutive operating loss in July.\nIn fact, retailers across the U.S. are cutting prices to clear a pile of inventories of goods that are no more in demand. Amazon‚Äôs decision to hold a second Prime Day shopping event this year signals that the online retailer may be dealing with similar issues.\nWith slowing e-commerce sales, Amazon investors are also worried about cost escalation following a massive pandemic-era expansion that left the company struggling to justify its vast warehouse space and inflated paysheet. Fulfillment expenses jumped 14% to $20.3 billion, virtually the same as the previous three-month period.\nHurt by these headwinds, AMZN stock is down more than 30% this year, underperforming its large-cap tech giants, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe Silver Lining\nWhile these pressures will continue to hurt the company this year and likely the next, there is no reason for investors to abandon AMZN stock. A weak period is generally the best time for innovative companies like Amazon to strengthen their market share further. \nAmazon‚Äôs share of U.S. e-commerce sales grew to 40% in 2021, making it the fastest-growing large U.S. retailer in this segment. I don‚Äôt see that expansion slowing, especially when U.S. e-commerce sales made up just 13.2% of total retail sales, with much room for digital commerce to grow.\nInvestors should also note that Amazon‚Äôs business isn‚Äôt just about e-commerce. The company‚Äôs cloud-computing and advertising units are still showing impressive expansion.\nRevenue for Amazon Web Services grew 33% in the second quarter, while its advertising business, for which the company recently began breaking out financial data, grew 18% during the same period. According to Synergy Research Group, the company now has 34% of the almost $55 billion market for cloud infrastructure services. \nConsidering its healthy balance sheet, high free cash flows, and highly diversified business model, it‚Äôs not difficult to see that Amazon remains in a solid position to withstand the current hostile economic environment.\nIn a note to clients today, JPMorgan reiterated Amazon as overweight, saying the giant is ‚Äúwell positioned for long-term growth‚Äù heading into earnings on Thursday.\n‚ÄúWe recently trimmed estimates given increased FX headwinds & slowing discretionary spending. Still, we remain confident AMZN can re-accelerate revenue growth and expand OI margins into 2023, largely driven by Retail improvement and still solid AWS growth.‚Äù\nAmazon‚Äôs leading position in many areas in which it operates is the main reason that most Wall Street analysts rate its stock a buy. In an Investing.com poll of 54 analysts, 49 rate the stock as a buy, with their consensus 12-month price target showing a 44% upside.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nOf course, owning Amazon still comes at a price, even though the stock has gotten cheaper this year. Currently, AMZN trades for 50 times the earnings projected over the next 12 months. The Nasdaq 100, by contrast, has an average multiple of about half of that.\nStill, betting on the company has been hugely profitable for long-term investors, with its stock surging about 900% during the past decade.\nBottom Line\nAmazon stock may show more weakness after it releases its latest earnings report tomorrow. That slump shouldn‚Äôt be a reason to feel pessimistic about the company‚Äôs future, given its dominance in e-commerce and explosive growth in its cloud and advertising businesses.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author is long on AMZN, AAPL, and MSFT.
