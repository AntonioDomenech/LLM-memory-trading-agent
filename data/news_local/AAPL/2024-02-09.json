Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nNVDA\n0.37%\n\nAMD\n1.86%\n\nCRUS\n1.40%\n\nCirrus Logic shares lagged behind those of its bigger peers last year, but that's set to change.\nThis week's earnings have caught investors by surprise in the best possible way.\nAlready, the stock is tracking towards last year's all-time high and looks good value to keep on going.\nWith so much of the talk around semiconductor stocks dominated by the likes of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Dynamics (NASDAQ:AMD), and the like, it's easy to think there aren't that many smaller-cap chip stocks floating about. However, even with a market cap of less than $5 billion, compared to NVIDIA's $1.7 trillion, Cirrus Logic Inc (NASDAQ:CRUS Inc). can still pack a punch.\nIt rode the artificial intelligence (AI) inspired boom in chip stocks a year ago but then underperformed many of its bigger peers through the fall. An end-of-year rally to the tune of 30% showed the potential it had, and this is a theme that's been built on with yesterday's 15% jump.\nThe latest catalyst for the move higher was the company's fiscal Q3 earnings, which were released on Tuesday evening. Cirrus managed to beat analyst expectations for both headline numbers, with revenue coming in at a record high alongside its best-ever EPS print of $2.57.\nBullish outlook\nBeyond the beat on the big numbers, the company's forward guidance also came in hot, which itself can be a major driver of upward momentum in share price. It effectively says that the market has been undervaluing a stock based on future expectations that have now been raised by the business itself. It's one of the most bullish signals a company can give, and it's no surprise that investors have been impressed by it.\nThey've also been impressed by what they're seeing as a higher level of execution from senior leadership. Starting off 2024 with the highest revenue and EPS print is exactly what investors would have been looking for, and it bodes well for Cirrus' prospects in the months ahead. Significant milestones were ticked off with regard to the production of next-generation audio components, while the company also made notable progress in its process technology and foundry strategy.\nIt also saw strong customer engagement with its laptop solutions and advanced several R&D programs in the high-performance mixed-signal business. CEO John Forsyth pointed to all these and emphasized the company's robust product roadmap, which he sees pushing shares on to further gains through 2024 and beyond.\nPrevious concerns around the company's dependence on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), who as a customer has been responsible for upwards of 80% of Cirrus' revenue, are continuing to dissipate, with Forsyth opening up more Android-focused revenue channels and diversifying the company's overall turnover.\nHigh expectations\nSo, just how far can Cirrus rally from here? Well, the past few days have seen several major upgrades from analysts, who've been boosting their price targets accordingly. Susquehanna and TD Cowen, for example, both came out bullish on the stock, each giving it a fresh price target of $100. Even including yesterday's pop, that's still pointing to a further upside of more than 10%. Were Cirrus shares able to hit that in the coming weeks, they'd be within touching distance of last April's all-time high, and you'd have to be thinking they'd be good value to keep on going.\nThe risk-on sentiment sweeping equities right now is just too good to be ignored, due in large part to the growing consensus that the Fed has managed a soft landing. Inflation readings are continuing to cool, and expectations for an end to rate hikes, and maybe even a cut, are growing. While the relative strength index (RSI) for Cirrus' shares is reading 70, suggesting the stock is overbought, it's nowhere near high enough to be a cause for concern right now.\nWith the semiconductor industry as a whole bouncing back from a tough couple of years and with Cirrus hitting record revenue and earnings numbers, there's a lot of upward momentum left to play out before investors should be getting wary.\nOriginal Post\n\nCirrus Logic A Chip Stock You’re Going to Hear a Lot More About\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment Guidelines\n\nTrade With A Regulated Broker\n\nIndices\nCommodities\nBonds\nStocks\n\nUS 30 \n45,907.50\n+73.3\n+0.16%\n\nUS 500 \n6,593.30\n+9.0\n+0.14%\n\nDow Jones \n45,834.22\n-273.78\n-0.59%\n\nS&P 500 \n6,584.29\n-3.18\n-0.05%\n\nNasdaq \n22,141.10\n+98.03\n+0.44%\n\nS&P 500 VIX \n15.10\n+0.34\n+2.30%\n\nDollar Index \n97.02\n-0.126\n-0.13%\n\nCrude Oil WTI Futures\n62.76\n+0.07\n+0.11%\n\nBrent Oil Futures\n67.01\n+0.02\n+0.03%\n\nNatural Gas Futures\n2.946\n+0.005\n+0.17%\n\nGold Futures\n3,678.02\n-8.38\n-0.23%\n\nSilver Futures\n42.668\n-0.163\n-0.38%\n\nCopper Futures\n4.6543\n+0.0023\n+0.05%\n\nUS Soybeans Futures\n1,040.88\n-5.13\n-0.49%\n\nU.S. 10Y \n4.066\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nU.S. 30Y \n4.681\n+0.002\n+0.04%\n\nU.S. 5Y \n3.625\n0.000\n0.00%\n\nU.S. 3M \n4.038\n+0.007\n+0.17%\n\nUS 10Y T-Note Futures\n113.28\n0.00\n0.00%\n\nEuro Bund Futures\n128.74\n-0.14\n-0.11%\n\n10-2 Yield Spread \n31.32\n+4.15\n+15.27%\n\nAAPL\n234.07\n+4.04\n+1.76%\n\nNVDA\n177.82\n+0.65\n+0.37%\n\nGOOGL\n240.80\n+0.43\n+0.18%\n\nTSLA\n395.94\n+27.13\n+7.36%\n\nAMZN\n228.15\n-1.80\n-0.78%\n\nNFLX\n1,188.44\n-15.06\n-1.25%\n\nMETA\n755.59\n+4.69\n+0.62%\n\nInvesting Challenges\nJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!\n\nTake the Challenge\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nSecure your InvestingPro subscription for LESS than $9 month for limited time only\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nChina says Nvidia broke competition rules, extends probe; stock dips\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nFutures mixed; Fed decision looms; U.S.-China talks - what’s moving markets\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nBitcoin price today: edges up to $116k on rate cut bets, altcoins lag\nBy Investing.co...\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\nAsia stocks hold sharp gains; S.
