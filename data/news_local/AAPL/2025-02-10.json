The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. \"The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,\" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: \"This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.
