Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nNDX\n0.42%\n\nDJI\n-0.59%\n\nBA\n-1.84%\n\nCVX\n-0.72%\n\nCAT\n0.03%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nCL\n0.51%\n\nNG\n0.24%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nWith some of the largest US companies reporting their quarterly earnings in the upcoming week, investors will look for signs of strength after the biggest weekly sell-off in equities over the past two years. \nDuring the five-day period ahead, about a third of the Dow’s 30 mega cap companies are scheduled to release their most recent numbers along with their outlook forecasts for the remainder of this year, including aerospace and defense behemoth Boeing (NYSE:BA) and heavy machinery giant Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT).\nThese earnings will be released in the wake of the NASDAQ 100 Index suffering its worst weekly performance since March 2020 on concerns that upcoming rising interest rates won’t justify the sky-high valuations of some tech giants. \nDuring this crucial week for the Q4 earnings season, we will be focusing on three mega caps whose earnings could help clarify whether they are still benefiting from the pandemic-driven demand surge that pushed their shares to record high prices in recent months:\n1. Tesla\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report Q4 earnings on Wednesday, Jan. 26 after the market close. Analysts are expecting $2.26 a share profit on sales of $16.99 billion.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based EV manufacturer earlier this month reported that it had delivered 308,600 vehicles worldwide in Q4, smashing the previous record. The better-than-expected deliveries pushed Tesla’s total sales for the year to more than 936,000, up about 87% over 2020’s deliveries. \nThis impressive performance showed that the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, is succeeding at overcoming the supply chain issues that are hurting traditional automakers.\nThe robust demand for Tesla’s cars, however, failed to protect its shares from the pullback that's pressured high-growth tech names since the beginning of this year. Tesla shares are down about 11% since the start of 2022, closing on Friday at $943.90. The stock surged to a record high of $1243.49 in November 2021.\n2. Apple\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of the popular and iconic iPhone, as well as computers and smart wearables, is scheduled to report its fiscal 2022, first quarter earnings on Thursday, Jan. 27 after the market close. Analysts, on average, project the company will post $1.89 a share profit on sales of $118.74 billion.\n\nInvestors will likely focus on the company’s ability to meet strong demand for its products amid supply chain hurdles which had dented the Cupertino, California-based company's sales in the previous quarter. CEO Tim Cook warned in October that the shortage of semiconductors was affecting “pretty much” all of the company’s products.  \nDuring the holiday quarter, Apple’s sales were forecast to hit a record high, fueled by the rollout of new watches, iPads, Mac computers and other items.\nShares of Apple closed at $162.41 on Friday after falling about 8% this month. But that performance is better than the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100's which declined 12% over the same period.\n3. Chevron\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) will report Q4 earnings on Friday, Jan. 28 before the market open. The US oil and gas major is expected to post EPS of $3.11 on sales of $44.59 billion, according to consensus forecasts.\n\nIn its latest update, the San Ramon, California-based, integrated energy, chemicals and petroleum firm said it plans to use windfall profits to facilitate share buybacks as soaring energy prices boost cash flows. Chevron is considering an expansion of its buyback program after surging natural gas prices and oil-refining returns drove free cash flow to an all-time high in the third quarter.\nRising crude oil prices are now about 70% higher than they were in early 2020, and the International Energy Agency said last week that global oil demand this year will exceed levels seen before the pandemic.\nChevron shares closed on Friday at $126.91, after rising 26% during the past six months.\n\n3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week: Tesla, Apple, Chevron\n\nView all comments (5)5\n\nLatest

Markets\n\nPublished01/23/2022, 07:32 AM\n\n1 Stock To Buy, 1 To Dump When Markets Open: McDonald’s, Robinhood\n\nView all comments (12)12\n\nInvesting.com\nArticles(7970)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nBA\n-1.84%\n\nCVX\n-0.72%\n\nT\n0.27%\n\nCAT\n0.03%\n\nINTC\n-2.15%\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nMCD\n-0.98%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nMA\n-1.41%\n\nVZ\n-0.39%\n\nNUE\n-1.67%\n\nJNJ\n-0.25%\n\nGE\n0.05%\n\nV\n-1.18%\n\nYUM\n0.23%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nIXIC\n0.44%\n\nWEN\n-2.33%\n\nQSR\n-0.88%\n\nHOOD\n-2.31%\n\nStocks on Wall Street plunged in risk-off trade on Friday, with the NASDAQ Composite suffering its worst weekly loss since 2020, pushing the tech-heavy index further into correction territory.\nIn fact, the NASDAQ is off to its worst start to a year since 2008, tumbling 12% so far in January amid a broad selloff in many top-rated technology stocks. The index now stands 15% below its all-time high.\n\nThis week we'll see Q4 earnings season kick into high gear, with reports expected from mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\nNot to be outdone, additional high-profile companies, such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Nucor (NYSE:NUE) will also be releasing their latest earnings results.\nTo top it all off, we'll see fourth quarter growth data, plus hear from the Fed as it holds its latest monetary policy meeting with subsequent press conference, making it a busy week indeed.\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below we highlight one stock likely to be in demand in the coming days and another which could see fresh losses.\nRemember though, our timeframe is just for the week ahead.\nStock To Buy: McDonald’s\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock could see increased buying activity this week, as investors await the latest financial results, due for release before the opening bell on Jan. 27, from one of the world’s largest restaurant chains. Consensus expectations call for the Chicago, Illinois-based fast-food giant—which has topped Wall Street estimates for three consecutive quarters—to post Q4 earnings per share of $2.34, rising 37.6% from EPS of $1.70 in the year-ago period.\nRevenue is forecast to climb 13.5% year-over-year to $6.03 billion, benefitting from higher menu prices, a successful digital loyalty program, as well as unique marketing promotions which boosted consumer demand for its iconic lineup of ‘Big Mac’ burgers and chicken ‘McNuggets.’\nAs such, market players will focus on the company’s U.S. same-store sales, which track sales at stores open for at least 12 months, after the key metric grew by 9.6% in the previous quarter.\nOutside the U.S., international same-store sales are expected to improve from a year ago, when they increased 12.7%, as consumers flocked back to the fast-food chain’s physical restaurants amid easing COVID-19 restrictions.\nBeyond the top- and bottom-line numbers, McDonald’s outlook for the months ahead will be in focus as the chain deals with worries surrounding higher labor, commodity, and transportation costs, as well as staffing shortages.\nFast-food chains are being closely watched for their ability to pass on inflation costs to consumers.\n\nMCD touched an all-time high of $271.15 on Jan. 4; it ended Friday’s session at $254.59. At current levels, the fast-food restaurant chain has a market cap of $190.2 billion.\nDespite losing 5% since the start of the year, McDonald’s stock has outperformed other notable names in the sector, such as The Wendy’s Co (NASDAQ:WEN), Burger King-parent Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which owns KFC and Taco Bell.\nNot surprisingly, 27 out of 37 analysts surveyed by Investing.com rate the stock as “outperform,” implying an almost 8% upside from current levels with a 12-month price target of $274.55/share.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nStock To Dump: Robinhood Markets\nAfter correctly predicting a couple of weeks ago that Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock will break down to new lows, shares are expected to suffer another challenging week as investors brace for disappointing financial results from the beleaguered trading app.\nConsensus estimates call for the struggling Menlo Park, California-based stock market-trading platform to post a loss of $0.37 per share on revenue of $374.8 million when it reports fourth quarter numbers after the closing bell on Thursday, Jan. 27.\nThe fintech company warned that lower retail trading activity and seasonal headwinds would likely persist into year-end when it released weaker-than-expected Q3 financial results in October.\nBased on moves in the options market, traders are pricing in a big move for HOOD shares following the results, with a possible implied move of about 17% in either direction.\nAnother potential cause for concern is what insiders plan to do with their shares after a lock-up period that prevented them from selling equity following the company’s IPO last year ends on Tuesday, Jan. 25. If they were to sell even a fraction of their holdings, it could put large technical selling pressure on Robinhood’s stock.\n\nHOOD started trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $38 following a much-hyped IPO in July 2021. It closed at a record low of $12.98 on Friday, nearly 85% below its record high of $84.12 touched on Aug. 4. At current levels, the financial services company has a market cap of $11.1 billion.\nYear-to-date, Robinhood stock has tanked, -26.9%, as investors dumped shares of unprofitable technology companies amid rising rates due to the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace than previously expected.\nYet, despite recent losses, HOOD stock still appears to be overvalued according to InvestingPro models and could see a decline of 25% to its fair value of $9.70 a share.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nTaking this into account, shares of the stock-and-crypto trading app will likely remain vulnerable to sharp swings in the days ahead.\n\n1 Stock To Buy, 1 To Dump When Markets Open: McDonald’s, Robinhood\n\nView all comments (12)12\n\nLatest comments\n\nPost\n\nComment
