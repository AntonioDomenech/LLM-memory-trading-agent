Report know that The Arora Report has an unparalleled record of making accurate buy and sell calls on gold. Here are two Arora calls that have been credited with moving gold across the globe.\n\nThe chart shows an Arora sell signal given in 2011 at $1904 on exactly the day gold topped before falling to nearly $1000.\nIn 2016, when almost everyone on Wall Street had anointed Hillary Clinton as the next president, even before the election, The Arora Report was among a small minority that predicted Trump would win. On election night, as results came in and it became apparent that Trump would win, gold soared. At the exact top, The Arora Report gave a sell signal which was picked up by Arora Report members in Asia, which started a cascade of selling. Business Standard, the Wall Street Journal of India, credited The Arora Report with moving gold in its headline. Here is the Business Standard article: Arora Report Creates Ripples In Bullion Market.\n\n\nThe chart shows the resistance zone

a critical support level — the 200-day moving average — further cementing the ongoing bearish trend.\nMonday brought a negative start to the week on Wall Street, with the index representing the top 500 American companies by market capitalization, closely monitored through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), plummeting below the 4,200-point threshold. \nAfter the initial negative price
