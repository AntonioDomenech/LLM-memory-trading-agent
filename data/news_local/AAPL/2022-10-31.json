Anwar\nArticles(1312)\n\nFollow\n\nNDX\n0.42%\n\nUS500\n-0.05%\n\nCVX\n-0.72%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nXOM\n0.02%\n\nCL\n0.54%\n\nNG\n1.09%\n\nPG\n-0.46%\n\nTSLA\n7.36%\n\nVDE\n-0.61%\n\nExxon runs one of the most defensive portfolios within its peer group\nExxon‚Äôs latest earnings report provided strong evidence to back a bull case for its stock\nAnother big difference in the latest oil boom is that Exxon isn‚Äôt deviating from its spending discipline\nIt‚Äôs a great time to be an investor in energy stocks. After many years of underperformance that lasted until the market crash of 2020, oil and gas producers are firing on all cylinders.\nVanguard Energy Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VDE)‚Äîwhose top 10 holdings include Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX)‚Äî has soared 62% this year, adding to 224% gains during the past two years. During that time, the benchmark S&P 500 delivered an 18% return, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 Index is almost flat.\nAfter reaping these spectacular gains, a dilemma that many investors like me are facing is whether this is the right time to take some money off the table. Though it‚Äôs impossible to time the market, the rationale behind this thinking is quite clear. \n\nThe risk of a prolonged recession is real, given the sticky nature of inflation and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs resolve to tame it through its aggressive monetary tightening drive. Oil has shed about a quarter of its value since June amid rising interest rates and the weakening demand from China, where authorities continue to impose strict lockdowns to prevent COVID-19 spread.\nWhile these headwinds are real and could end the party abruptly in oil stocks, I don‚Äôt recommend fully closing this trade at this point. And I‚Äôm sticking with my position in Exxon, the largest oil and gas producer in the U.S. Its stock, which hit an all-time high today, is up more than 80% this year.\nThe current dynamics in energy markets favor super-majors like XOM. My reason to hold Exxon is that the company runs one of the most defensive portfolios within its peer group. It has the right mix of assets, with exposure to international gas and liquified natural gas (LNG)‚Äîa commodity that is in extremely short supply due to the Russian conflict in Europe. The diversified nature of its business will keep it well-supported even if oil demand weakens.\nHighest-Ever Profit \nThe Texas-based Exxon‚Äôs latest earnings report provided strong evidence to back up a bull case for XOM. Even when oil prices dipped in the previous quarter, Exxon was able to post the highest profit in its 152-year history on the strength of natural gas demand. Exxon, according to a Bloomberg report, is forecast to post full-year profit in excess of $50 billion ‚Äì more than Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) combined.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nAnother big difference that will sustain this post-pandemic rally is that the company isn‚Äôt deviating from its spending discipline. That‚Äôs a major shift from the past booms when the energy producer went on to massively increase its development budget, leaving less money to return to shareholders.\nExxon in its recent guidance told investors that it has locked long-term spending at about $22.5 billion a year ‚Äì 30% below pre-COVID levels ‚Äì with production growth from Guyana and the Permian Basin largely offsetting asset sales and natural field declines elsewhere. The spending discipline and the cost cuts made during the pandemic will help the producer to achieve a lower break-even cost of about $30-a-barrel by 2027, down from $41 in 2021. \nHighlighting this strength, Jefferies said in a note to clients that Exxon is situated to outperform peers in the next five years given its strong financial position.\n‚ÄúXOM is ‚Äòon the front foot‚Äô and we see attractive risk/reward, particularly for generalists needing energy exposure,‚Äù the note said, citing opportunities in both its upstream and downstream businesses. \nThe note further adds:\n‚ÄúCash flow growth guidance achievable driven by cost reduction and portfolio high-grading, even in the backwardated commodity environment and lower than consensus downstream earnings.‚Äù\nAnother reason to remain bullish on XOM's prospects is the company's solid dividend and share buyback program, which offers a great incentive for long-term investors to hold this name in their portfolios. Exxon now pays $0.91 a share quarterly dividend, which translates into a 3.29% annual dividend yield. \nExxon paid more in dividends over the last 12 months than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did to become the second-largest in the S&P 500 Index. In addition to payouts, Exxon is also spending $15 billion this year to buy back its shares, one of the largest among bluechip companies.\nBottom Line\nIt‚Äôs perhaps a good time to trim some of your energy holdings after reaping massive benefits during the past two years. But for long-term investors, keeping some exposure to this crucial segment of the market isn‚Äôt a bad idea. XOM stock is my favorite in this group due to the company‚Äôs defensive nature and its preference to return cash to existing shareholders. \nDisclaimer: At the time of writing, the author is long on Exxon stock.

Will Bet Pay Off?\nByFrank HolmesStock Markets\n\nPublished10/31/2022, 12:48 PM\n\nMeta Blowing Through Billions In Free Cash Flow. Will Bet Pay Off?\n\nView all comments (1)1\n\nFrank Holmes\nArticles(783)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nMSFT\n1.77%\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nBTC/USD\n0.10%\n\nIn 1990, a new tech start-up was spun out of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to invent the future.\nGeneral Magic, as it was called, was a veritable dream factory.\nOver the course of its 12-year existence, its founders‚Äîformer Apple engineers who had helped bring the original Macintosh computer to fruition‚Äîdeveloped technologies and applications that wouldn‚Äôt be in common use for several more years. Chief among them was a precursor to the smartphone, but more than that, the General Magic team foresaw the age of mobile computing in totality, complete with social media, e-commerce and emojis.\nAlas, no one bought its products, and General Magic was forced to close shop in 2002, a couple of years before anyone was friended on ‚ÄúTheFacebook‚Äù and five years before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone to the world.\nModern history is full of inventions and technologies that failed not because they were inherently flawed, but because they hit the market several years too early. Before the iPad, there was the Microsoft Tablet (released way back in 2001). Before Bitcoin, there was Bit Gold (conceived in 1998).\nLast week, autonomous vehicle start-up Argo AI announced it was shutting down after only five years, with financial backer Ford saying that commercialization of the technology is ‚Äúfurther out than originally anticipated.‚Äù\nThe question now on many investors‚Äô minds is: Will Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs metaverse project follow the same path as General Magic and Argo AI, or will it go in the direction of the iPhone?\nFAANG No More?\nEver since Zuckerberg announced his company‚Äôs pivot more than a year ago (he would officially change the name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in October 2021 to reflect the new emphasis), the way forward has been challenging at best.\nOver the past couple of years, Meta has generated billions of dollars in free cash flow (FCF), nearly all of it now spent on developing metaverse applications that, as of now, don‚Äôt appear to be profitable. Last week, the company reported FCF of only $316 million in the third quarter, down significantly from $12.7 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nThe market has not been kind. A day after Meta‚Äôs earnings call, when Zuckerberg asked investors for ‚Äúpatience,‚Äù shares of the company plunged a jaw-dropping 25%, its third-worst trading session ever. For the year, the stock is down more than 71%.\nBriefly a $1-trillion company alongside fellow FAANG stocks Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta is no longer in the top 30 largest companies, as its market capitalization has fallen to around $250 billion. In just 13 months, Zuckerberg's net worth has dropped by an unbelievable $100 billion.\n\nSpending In The Metaverse Is Down Substantially\nOf course, none of this should matter much if you believe in the long-term opportunities that the metaverse may present over time. According to one estimate, a quarter of all people will spend at least one hour a day in a metaverse of one kind or another for work, entertainment or shopping by 2026. If that‚Äôs the case, Meta‚Äôs stock may look very attractive at its current price of under $95.\nAt the same time, there are signs that spending in the metaverse is stalling substantially. Prices for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have collapsed, while sales fell 60% from the second to third quarters. Virtual worlds trading volume fell close to 92% between quarters, according to DappRadar.\nLike others, I believe this slowdown is a result of our coming out of the pandemic. When we were all stuck at home, the idea of exploring virtual worlds was very inviting, and many young people were looking for ways to spend their government ‚Äústimmy‚Äù checks. Now, people may be more inclined to spend their money on analog experiences, like eating out, travel, live shows and more.\nA Lesson From Bezos: It‚Äôs All About The Long Term\nFor investors who are still on the fence about Meta, it may be instructive to remember the last time a tech giant made a massive, ill-advised bet on a technology outside of its core discipline. When Jeff Bezos first came up with the idea for Amazon Web Services (AWS) many people called it risky and foolish. A 2006 BusinessWeek article was highly critical of the cloud-computing project and suggested there would be no significant returns for many years to come.\nFast forward to today, and Bezos now has a framed copy of that magazine ‚Äúas a reminder.‚Äù In May, he tweeted that the service Wall Street initially scoffed at generated $62 billion in revenue in 2021.\nIn fact, AWS has steadily become Amazon‚Äôs main profit driver. Its operating income represented a whopping three-quarters of the company‚Äôs total operating income last year. AWS, the company‚Äôs chief financial officer (CFO) said in 2021, is ‚Äúarguably the most profitable important technical technology company in the world.‚Äù\n\nBezos has always kept his eye on the future. In his very first letter to shareholders in 1997, he stressed that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about the long term‚Äù and promised to make ‚Äúbold rather than timid investment decisions.‚Äù In 2005, he acknowledged that while these new investments were ‚Äúexpensive in the short term,‚Äù he believed them to be ‚Äúimportant and valuable in the long term.‚Äù In 2012, he pushed back against criticisms that the company‚Äôs ‚Äúheavy investments‚Äù in AWS and Prime were ‚Äúat odds with being a for-profit company.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúTake a long-term view, and the interests of customers and shareholders align.‚Äù\nThe same could be said about Zuckerberg‚Äôs pivot into the metaverse. Time will tell, but I think that as long as Meta can stay afloat until the appetite for the metaverse catches up with the technology, shareholders‚Äô interests could also eventually align with Meta customers‚Äô interests.\nAll opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.
