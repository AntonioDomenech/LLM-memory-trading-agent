Brady couldn‚Äôt own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.\nNetflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn‚Äôt a reality when Brady joined the league.

Nasdaq has gotten off to a strong start in 2023, outperforming the Dow and S&P 500 by a wide margin.\nHigh-growth tech stocks have come back in favor, thanks to easing inflation and rate hike fears.\nAs such, I recommend adding Okta and Workday to your portfolio amid their solid fundamentals and long-term growth outlook.\nStocks on Wall Street have gotten off to a strong start to 2023, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite notching its biggest January gain since 2001 as investors rotated back into the beaten-down growth stocks of yesteryear.\nThe Nasdaq is up 10.3% so far in the new year, compared to a 6.2% gain for the benchmark S&P 500 index and a 2.6% increase for the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nThe recent rally has been fueled by growing signs that inflation may have peaked, raising hopes the Federal Reserve will become less aggressive on interest rate hikes in the months ahead.\nThat in turn has boosted shares of the mega-cap tech companies, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), all posting double-digit year-to-date percentage increases thus far.\n\nTaking that into account, I recommend buying shares of Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) as investors pile back into beaten-down tech growth names following last year‚Äôs selloff amid receding worries over rising Fed interest rates, elevated inflation, and recessionary fears.\nOkta\nYear-To-Date Performance: +7.7%\nPercentage From ATH: -75%\nOkta, which helps businesses and organizations around the world manage and secure user authentication, is widely considered the leader in the fast-growing identity and access management space. As such, I believe shares of the security software maker are a smart buy amid the current geopolitical climate, especially at current valuations.\nOKTA stock settled at $73.61 yesterday, its highest close since August 31, 2022. Shares have rebounded significantly since falling to a four-year low of $44.12 in early November, rising almost 67% in the past three months.\nNonetheless, OKTA remains a far cry from its record high of $294 touched in February 2021. At current valuations, the San Francisco, California-based tech firm has a market cap of $11.8 billion, a steep discount to its peak valuation of $42 billion.\n\nThe identity and access management specialist remains well-placed to benefit from robust demand for its cloud-based cybersecurity offerings as the economy undergoes a sea change of digitization and enterprises spend more on cloud migration. Okta provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, web services, and devices.\nI anticipate Okta - which has beaten Wall Street‚Äôs top and bottom line expectations for 24 straight quarters dating back to Q3 2017 - will deliver upbeat earnings when it releases its latest financial results on Thursday, March 2 after the closing bell.\nIndeed, data from InvestingPro suggest that Wall Street analysts are extremely optimistic ahead of the report, with analysts increasing their EPS estimates 27 times in the last 90 days to reflect a gain of over 200% from their initial expectations.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nConsensus forecasts call for earnings per share of $0.09, swinging from a loss of -$0.18 in the year-ago period. If confirmed, it would mark the most profitable quarter in Okta‚Äôs history since going public in April 2017.\nRevenue is forecast to jump 27.9% y-o-y to an all-time high of $489.9 million, as the company benefits from strong demand from large enterprises for its cloud-based identity and access management software, which helps enterprises connect securely to their employees and customers.\nIn a promising sign, Okta counted more than 17,000 organizations around the world as customers as of the end of Q3, rising 22% from the year-ago period. Additionally, the cyber company said it had 3,740 clients generating $100,000 in annual revenue, up 32% from the same period last year.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nAs could be expected, 36 out of 38 analysts surveyed by Investing.com rate OKTA stock either as a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô or ‚Äòhold‚Äô, reflecting a bullish recommendation. Among those surveyed, shares had roughly 9% upside potential based on Tuesday‚Äôs closing price. Similarly, the quantitative models in InvestingPro point to a gain of 22.7% in OKTA stock over the next 12 months, bringing shares closer to their average fair value of $90.34.\nWorkday\nYear-To-Date Performance: +8.4%\nPercentage From ATH: -41%\nWorkday ‚Äî which offers enterprise-level software solutions for financial management and human resources, such as payroll tools ‚Äî has enjoyed a powerful rebound since seeing its stock slump to a bear market low of around $128 in early November.\nShares of the human resources software maker have run about 41% higher in the past three months, far outpacing the comparable returns of major industry peers, such as Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) (-4.7%), Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) (-1.8%), and Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) (-1.7%), over the same timeframe.\nDespite the recent rally, shares, which closed at $181.43 last night, remain 41% below their November 2021 all-time high of $307.81. At current levels, the Pleasanton, California-based company, which counts big names like Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Netflix, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as customers, has a market cap of $46.6 billion, compared to a valuation of roughly $75 billion at its peak.\n\nI believe Workday remains well-positioned to achieve ongoing long-term growth despite the challenging operating environment as it cements its status as the premier go-to name in the HR management industry.\nThe next major upside catalyst is expected to arrive when Workday reports fourth quarter financial results after the U.S. market closes on Monday, February 27.\nThe finance/HR software specialist has either matched or topped Wall Street‚Äôs sales expectations in every quarter since going public in Q3 2012 while missing profit estimates only twice in that span, a testament to strong execution across the company over the years.\nAn InvestingPro survey of analyst earnings revisions points to growing optimism ahead of the earnings release, with analysts raising their EPS estimates 16 times in the last 90 days, compared to 13 downward revisions. The upward revisions follow a strong earnings result in late November that sent shares surging upward.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\nConsensus estimates call for the enterprise software company to post earnings per share of $0.90, according to Investing.com, improving 15.4% from EPS of $0.78 in the year-ago period due to the positive impact of ongoing operational restructuring actions and cost-cutting measures.\nQ4 revenue is forecast to increase 18.1% year-over-year to $1.63 billion. If that is in fact the reality, it would mark the highest quarterly sales total in Workday‚Äôs history, thanks to an expected boost in demand for its cloud-based human capital management and financial management software solutions.\n\nSource: Investing.com\nUnsurprisingly, Wall Street has a long-term bullish view on WDAY stock, with 37 out of 38 analysts surveyed by Investing.com rating it as either ‚Äòbuy‚Äô or ‚Äòhold‚Äô. Shares have an average analyst price target of around $202, representing an upside of roughly 11% from current levels. Likewise, the average fair value for Workday‚Äôs stock on InvestingPro according to a number of valuation models ‚Äî including P/E multiples ‚Äî implies roughly 14% upside over the next 12 months.\n***\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq via the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ).

Another Set of Weak Results\n\nView all comments (0)0\n\nShane Neagle\nArticles(191)|My Homepage\n\nFollow\n\nGOOGL\n0.18%\n\nAAPL\n1.76%\n\nAMZN\n-0.78%\n\nMETA\n0.62%\n\nSNAP\n0.69%\n\nShares of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are down sharply on Wednesday after the social media giant missed consensus estimates for Q4 2022 revenue. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 14 cents in the quarter, compared to analysts‚Äô expectations of 11 cents per share.\nRevenue came in at $1.30 billion in the three-month period, just below the $1.31 billion estimated by analysts. The social media company struggled to weather a difficult 2022 as a slowing global economy forced businesses to trim their digital ad budgets. Snap‚Äôs Q4 revenue was up slightly compared to a year ago.\nThe company reported 375 million Global Daily Active Users (DAUs) in the quarter, while analysts were looking for 375.3 million, according to StreetAccount. The average revenue per user stood at $3.47 in the quarter, missing the consensus projection of $3.49.\nAnother Disappointment for Snap\nThe results mark a third consecutive weaker-than-expected earnings report for Snap. This time, the social media company blamed the disappointing Q2 and Q3 reports on ‚Äúa challenging year‚Äù characterized by ‚Äúmacroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes, and increased competition.‚Äù On a full-year basis, Snap‚Äôs sales grew 12% to $4.6 billion in 2022.\nThe Santa Monica, California-based company said it would not issue guidance for the next quarter. However, the company said in the investor letter that its ‚Äúinternal forecast‚Äù expects a decline of 2% to 10% from the year-ago period.\nThe company said in the letter:\n‚ÄúOn the monetization side, we anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging, as we expect the headwinds we have faced over the past year to persist throughout Q1.‚Äù\nSnap said its Snapchat+ service had more than 2 million paying subscribers as of Q4. Launched last summer, the service represents a subscription plan that provides users with access to additional, exclusive features such as longer story expiration, custom notification sounds, and camera color borders for $3.99 a month.\nIn the wake of last year‚Äôs struggles, Snap announced in August it would slash 20% of its staff, translating to more than 6,000 employees. The company also scrapped multiple projects in 2022, including its Snap Original premium shows and its flying selfie drone.\nBracing for More Regulatory Headwinds\nSnap‚Äôs report marks a poor start to Q4 financial results season for ad-dependent businesses. Investors are set to gain additional insight into the market‚Äôs conditions later this week when the likes of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) report their earnings.\nFurthermore, there are no indications that 2023 will be any easier for U.S. social media companies as they brace for a series of new state and federal legal challenges with sweeping regulatory implications. Most U.S. state legislatures have proposed or adopted bills aimed at reforming how social media companies are moderating their content and protecting American users.\nMeanwhile, the supreme court is set to hear as many as four significant cases against internet companies, targeting their liabilities in terrorist attack attempts and the alleged censorship of conservative viewpoints on their respective platforms, among other things. Two state and federal lawsuits announced earlier this month are targeting how social media apps and their algorithms are affecting the mental health of U.S. teenagers.\nSeveral weeks ago, public schools in Seattle and the Kent school district took legal action against TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat, citing the promotion of ‚Äúharmful content to youth, such as pro-anorexia and eating disorder content.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe cannot ignore the mental health needs of our students and the role that social media companies play,‚Äù they added.\nMore recently, Utah governor Spencer Cox said the state plans to file a similar lawsuit, noting it will be geared towards protecting youth.\nTikTok U.S. Ban a Tailwind?\nAt the same time, TikTok is bending over backward to stay in the U.S., where it boasts over 100 million users. The Chinese internet behemoth is facing a ban in the world‚Äôs biggest tech market. In addition to a ban on installing the app on federal and state government-owned devices, TikTok owner ByteDance could be entirely prohibited from operating in the US and see its app removed from Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) app stores.\nWhile in theory, it would not make using the TikTok app illegal for users, it would make it significantly more difficult for them to actually get the app. However, it remains uncertain whether the U.S. government will commit to making such a big step.\nIf it does, on the other hand, it would represent a similar approach to China which has banned all of the popular U.S. apps including Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook.\nIn order to avoid the ban, ByteDance has spent millions of dollars to convince U.S. detractors that it does not take instructions from the Chinese government and that it is not providing it with U.S. user data. The social media company has also poured over $1 billion into ‚ÄúProject Texas,‚Äù an initiative aimed at rebuilding the TikTok app on U.S. servers in an effort to separate it from ByteDance and China.\nSummary\nSnap shares are moving lower this week after the social media company again disappointed investors.
